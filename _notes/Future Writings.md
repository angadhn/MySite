The following is a list of notes I should expand on further, such as:
- [[TheSiteRepo/_notes/Moravec's Paradox]]

There are some others that could be more technical that a historical perspective on:
- the role of rendezvous and docking in space stations that combines knowledge from:
	- [[TheSiteRepo/_notes/ISS assembly animation]]
	- [[TheSiteRepo/_notes/ISS Rendezvous & Docking]]
	- [[TheSiteRepo/_notes/ISS Connectors]]
	- [[TheSiteRepo/_notes/Examples of Commercial Space Stations]]
	Ideally this piece would offer some kind of perspective on bottlenecks and future directions
	we might wish to develop.
- A deeper perspective on inflatable stations developed thru history and where we might wish to futher invest in R&D:
	- [[TheSiteRepo/_notes/inflatable von Braun Stations]] + [[TheSiteRepo/_notes/BEAM video summary]]
	- [[TheSiteRepo/_notes/Reading Links Jan 2025 Part 3]] that has content on inflatables
	- [[TheSiteRepo/_notes/Saul Griffith on Inflatables]]
