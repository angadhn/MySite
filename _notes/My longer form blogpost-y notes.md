I sometimes get wound up enough that I will dive deeper into something in a research-y sense (especially on space things) but sometimes I will ruminate on the nature of being. The below is a list in no specific order:
- [[Some Space Stations in Fiction and Reality]]
- [[Inflatable von Braun Stations]]
- [[Graeber and Thiel on Stagnation]]

There are also some posts that I should expand on further, such as:
- [[Moravec's Paradox]]

There are some others that could be more technical that a historical perspective on:
- the role of rendezvous and docking in space stations that combines knowledge from:
	- [[ISS assembly animation]]
	- [[ISS Rendezvous & Docking]]
	- [[ISS Connectors]]
	- [[Examples of Commercial Space Stations]]
	Ideally this piece would offer some kind of perspective on bottlenecks and future directions
	we might wish to develop.
- A deeper perspective on inflatable stations developed thru history and where we might wish to futher invest in R&D:
	- [[inflatable von Braun Stations]] + [[BEAM video summary]]
	- [[Reading Links Jan 2025 Part 3]] that has content on inflatables
	- [[Saul Griffith on Inflatables]]
