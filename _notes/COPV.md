# Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels

A [Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_overwrapped_pressure_vessel) (COPV) is an alternative to all-metal [pressure vessels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_vessel). The metal variants were used in space vehicles of the 60s and 70s to store propellants and other fluids. A COPV comprises a metallic liner and an overwrap (that wraps around the liner)—together they contain gases or propellants. [Fiber reinforced polymers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre-reinforced_plastic "Fibre-reinforced plastic") (FRP) are most commonly used as composites, especially fibers of [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fiber "Carbon fiber") and [kevlar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevlar "Kevlar").

> For example for a pressure vessel that is 1,300 cubic inches with storing for example helium or a gas at 9700 psi that is equivalent to 3.6 pounds of TNT.

Their primary advantage over similar-sized metallic pressure vessel is from mass savings—they can be lighter by upto 50%. COPVs, however, carry an increased cost of manufacturing and certification.

The [three most important failures modes for COPVs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1EOi_yQL_M&list=PLpEqMkxe7Xk-9J-Ba1-nR7V1f8_MLRjt5&index=6) that need to be understood for long-term deep space misssions:
- LInear Fatigure Crack Growyth and Crazck frowth
- Impact damage
- Stress-Rupture mechanisms
