# Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels

[Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_overwrapped_pressure_vessel) were developed as an alternative all-metal pressure vessels used in space vehicles of the 60s and 70s to store propellants and other fluids. It comprises a metallic liner and an overwrap (that wraps around the liner)â€”together they contain gases or propellants.

> For example for a pressure vessel that is 1,300 cubic inches with storing for example helium or a gas at 9700 psi that is equivalent to 3.6 pounds of TNT.

Their primary advantage over similar-sized metallic pressure vessel is lowering mass by upto 50%; COPVs, however, carry an increased cost of manufacturing and certification.

- LInear Fatigure Crack Growyth and Crazck frowth
- Impact damage
- Stress-Rupture mechanisms
