I sometimes get wound up enough that I will dive deeper into something in a research-y sense (especially on space things) but sometimes I will ruminate on the nature of being. The below is a list in no specific order:
- [[Some Space Stations in Fiction and Reality]]
- [[Inflatable von Braun Stations]]
- [[Graeber and Thiel on Stagnation]]

There are also some posts that I should expand on further, such as:
- [[Moravec's Paradox]]
