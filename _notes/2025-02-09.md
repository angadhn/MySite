[Tyler Cowen's post](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/02/usps-as-a-failed-sovereign-wealth-fund.html) quoted an article on the [USPS as a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF)](https://gopostal.substack.com/p/usps-is-a-failed-sovereign-wealth). Below, I quote form other linked articles and a conversation with Claude to understand this model of SWF. Claude tells me that a Sovereign Wealth Fund is essentially a state-owned investment fund that invests in real assets (like real estate), financial assets (stocks, bonds), and alternative investments (private equity, hedge funds).
# Norway

> The value of Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, rose to a record 20 trillion crowns ($1.80 trillion) on Friday, doubling its value in just five years as oil and gas revenue flowed in and stock markets rose.

The money typically comes from a country's surplus reserves, often derived from natural resource revenues, trade surpluses, or foreign exchange reserves. Norway decided in the 1990s to save and invest its North Sea oil revenues for future generations rather than spend it all immediately. The goal was to:
1. Avoid "Dutch disease[^1]" (where natural resource wealth makes other sectors uncompetitive)
2. Ensure the oil wealth benefits future generations of Norwegians
3. Create a long-term diversified investment portfolio that isn't dependent on oil prices

The article goes on to say:
>  Its current value corresponds to about $321,000 for every man, woman and child living in the country of 5.6 million people.


The same article says:

> The fund's value was comparable in size to the annual GDP of Australia, a country with five times the population of Norway.

>  Bank Investment Management, which operates the fund, invests some 70% of assets in global stocks, about 25% in bonds and the rest in real estate and renewable energy plants, with most of its portfolio tracking international market indexes.

> Its single biggest holding was in U.S. government bonds, amounting to $136 billion or 7.5% of the fund at June 30, while the top corporate holdings were Microsoft Corp [(MSFT.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O) with $41 billion, Apple Inc [(AAPL.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AAPL.O)with $35 billion and Nvidia [(NVDA.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/NVDA.O) at $34 billion.

Claude tells me the key seems to be strong institutions and clear rules about how the money can be used. When done right, SWFs can help countries avoid the "resource curse[^2]" and create sustainable long-term wealth for their citizens.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

# Poorer countries
I asked Claude if poorer countries make use of SWFs and what the barriers are. I was told they are uncommon because they require:
- Significant surplus capital to invest
- Strong governance institutions
- Political willingness to save rather than spend immediately
- Long-term planning horizons
However, there are some success stories beyond Norway and Saudi Arabia. For example:
- Botswana's Pula Fund (from diamond revenues)
- Chile's Economic and Social Stabilization Fund (from copper revenues)

The reason Norway's approach with its sovereign wealth fund is so notable is that they actively worked to avoid these problems by:
	- Investing most oil revenue abroad (preventing currency overvaluation)
	- Maintaining strict rules about how much can be spent annually
	- Keeping the fund transparent and professionally managed
	- Diversifying their economy beyond oil

Many developing countries face immediate needs (infrastructure, education, healthcare) that make it politically difficult to save for the future. Additionally, some countries that have tried to create SWFs have struggled with corruption or political interference. Venezuela serves as a contrasting example - despite massive oil reserves, they spent heavily during boom times and didn't diversify, leading to severe economic problems when oil prices fell. Their experience demonstrates why the "save and invest" approach of SWFs can be so valuable for resource-rich nations.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​




[^1]: Named after what happened to the Netherlands in the 1960s after they discovered large natural gas fields. When a country discovers valuable natural resources, it typically leads to a surge in resource exports. The national currency becomes stronger due to high demand. This stronger currency makes other exports (like manufactured goods) more expensive and less competitive internationally. Traditional industries (manufacturing, agriculture) decline because they can't compete globally. Claude asked me to think of it like this: if Norway's oil makes its currency very strong, its fishing industry might suffer because Norwegian fish becomes too expensive for other countries to buy.

[^2]: Resource Curse (also called the "paradox of plenty") is the broader observation that countries with abundant natural resources often perform worse economically than countries without them. Again, Claude tells me this happens for several reasons such as Dutch Disease but also because Government dependence on resource revenue rather than tax revenue reduces accountability. Volatility in resource prices makes government budgets unstable. There’s also an increased risk of corruption and conflict over resource control. The govt may also end up  investment lesser in education and other sectors because the resource sector dominates.
