Last March, NASA, the United States space research agency, celebrated its hundredth birthday. NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics), founded on March 3, 1916, and later NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) which grew out of it in 1958, became the largest independent government agency over a hundred years, with 18 major space centers and research and test facilities across the United States.

In 1917, just over a year after NACA's founding, the Langley Research Center (LRC) was established first in Hampton, Virginia. Langley, which became the most influential workshop for the American space program, space flight, civil and military aviation, and space research, was operating 13 years after the first powered flight with the clear goal of coordinating aeronautical research and promoting the development of American aviation technology by creating the necessary technological background, as Europe was several steps ahead in this field at the time.

[The Langley celebrating its hundredth anniversary this year](https://www.nasa.gov/langley/100) had three different wind tunnels operating by the mid-1920s, helping developers and manufacturers design and build faster, more reliable aircraft with greater range. From the development of wing designs still used today, to streamlined fuselages and the development of the most efficient propellers, pioneering results were achieved in almost every area in LRC's increasingly advanced laboratories and wind tunnels. During World War II, thanks to the aerodynamic research conducted at Langley, the United States Air Force gained air superiority that fundamentally influenced the outcome of the war.

After the war, the scientists and engineers at Langley were primarily focused on breaking the sound barrier, developing all-metal aircraft, and solving the main problems of helicopters. By the late 1950s, the emerging American space program and later the announcement of the Apollo project naturally had a major impact on the Langley Research Center, with the analysis of key problems in spaceflight and Moon landing joining the center's main tasks alongside aviation research. Meanwhile, technological issues related to civil aviation have remained continuously on the agenda, and still are today, just think of the newly relevant development of supersonic passenger aircraft. The following photo gallery provides insight into Langley's rich history, thanks to the magnificent photographs found in NASA's photo archives.
