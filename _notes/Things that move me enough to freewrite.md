Reading or watching/listening to someone/something creative often inspires me. A smaller subset actually gets me off my ass to get to a notebook- I make this process pleasant by writing with a fountain pen. Once there’s enough on a page, I’ll know that I have either reached an end or, less often, I’ll feel like I need to get to a computer. Sometimes I finish what I need to say in a day or two but there are some that I can’t get done with in one day. I believe these are worthy of revisiting for further expansion as  [[Future Essays]].

Note: The space stuff I have been ingesting for a long time so those are more from researching something specific (like  [[ISS Connectors]]) or for teaching whereas writing about other topics (like  [[Moravec's Paradox]]) emerged from stumbling onto some specific content (usually mentioned in the piece).
