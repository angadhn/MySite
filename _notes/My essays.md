I sometimes get wound up enough that I will want to dive deeper into something in a research-y sense (especially on space and generally technology) but sometimes I contemplatively scribble in a notebook from a place of inspiration or frustration. It is good for my souls to come across such [[Things that move me enough to freewrite]]. 

The below is a list of the longer pieces that emerge from such scribbles in a physical notepad:
- [[Some Space Stations in Fiction and Reality]]
- [[Inflatable von Braun Stations]]
- [[Graeber and Thiel on Stagnation]] was from a place of frustration
- [[Varoufakis offers no solutions to achieve his vision]] was because of my frustration at his article.
- [[New York to Paris in 30 mins? How to achieve Elon Muskâ€™s vision of rockets replacing long haul]] was a piece requested by The Conversation- being in the right place at the right time?
