The increasing digitisation of human civilisation over the last 50 years has also increased each of our ability to leave behind a personal record like never before[^1]. From these plentiful records, future historians will work on piecing together a picture of life on our planet. I sense that conjectures and analyses about this moment will be remarkably different to those about Ancient Rome or the Indus Valley Civilisation purely because of the these electronic sources that permit a volume of personalities to be involved in public intellectual life. The bulk of our ancestral civilisations were maintained by authority; the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius remain popular to this day but do not make the life in these times any less coarse-grained as there is no way to undo the missing the granular description of life on the margins.

The digital makes us all immortal as we leave behind digital footprints whilst traversing the web of information at the tips of our fingers. At most times, I think this an unfortunate kind of involuntary immortality that feeds the engine of surveillance capitalism. The records of the passive internet-based citizen will appear not too different from those of the Roman peasantry in that this "modern" human's life is a record in another authoritarian entities documentation of the times.

But we can also choose to create digital footprints, not merely leave them behind. It is one step towards understanding the engine that drives the internet, why it feels permissionless to some but also why this is an incomplete truth. As we seize a little more of our reins on the internet, we may also begin a creative act of digital disobedience as we eventually leave behind a personal legacy. It offers a transcendental power in an afterlife that others are living whether I am around or not.



%% This is my version of my legacy- of a power transcendental in an afterlife (not for me, but for the life that others are living whether I am around or not). And where my legacy might end up being is not in the annals maintained by other, but myself. With a touch of my madness.

I didn’t think of it as reincarnation in the current life maybe but the idea being that I make somewhere aesthetic to read the things that also, hopefully, stir something in me. Something that is maybe action to work on something new or to return to update/edit the essay I’m reading because it’s just not there yet. %%

%% Power and influence are two sides of the same coin. And the desire for being powerful or influential can come from a place of trauma. Perhaps it can be the root of it.

But there is always a choice of how to wield them. Not abuse them.

And it’s very easy to fall into abuse, like with alcohol or pizza or drugs or sugar.

I believe it has its place. A desire to have some power and influence is not a fundamentally bad thing. I am confident that it has spurred a lot of art.

Heck, it’s one of the many reasons we might be having this conversation: to share our way of seeing things so that another might. Influence.

But both can corrupt the soul so to always be inward looking while looking out is such a crucial skill. Otherwise one very easily loses their way as they have lost the compass. The total compass that aligns inward intent to the outward direction of life’s trajectory. %%

 ## The Tools
 The tools for recording have undergone material transformations historically, clay tablets and chisels were replaced by notebooks and pencils but lacked the ethereality of the electronic.
 
 - not cheap and therefore not democratised %%
 

[^1]: The degree to which this is true for my or my parents' generation can be debated but it is certainly true for my grandparents, none of whom had any form of internet presence. The memories of my grandparents will fade from history if I don't make a record of their existence. And that was because they did not maintain their own personal records beyond the government documentation.
