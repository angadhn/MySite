_This essay is a Work in Progress._

The increasing digitisation of human civilisation over the last 50 years has increased each of our ability to leave behind a personal record like never before[^1]. The wider appreciation of this is still sinking in as we are largely worried about amkign records for their use and circulation today.

But if we look into the future, historians will piece together a picture of life on our planet in the Internet Age using our plentiful digital records. Analyses about this moment will be remarkably different, I suspect, to those of Ancient Rome or the Indus Valley Civilisation purely because such electronification permits a vast number to be involved in public intellectual life. In contrast, the bulk of our ancestral records were maintained by authority with a select few entering the domains of public intellectual life. Marcus Aurelius' Meditations remain popular to this day but I suspect that it can not capture the life of the common Roman. Thus we will only ever have a coarse-grained understanding of that era and there is really no way to undo that missing the granular description of life on the margins. Today's times are thus fundamentally different.

The digital offers us all an immortality as we leave behind digital footprints whilst traversing the web of information at the tips of our fingers and engage in digital commerce. At most times, I think this an unfortunate kind of soporific involuntary immortality that feeds the engine of surveillance capitalism. As a result of such passive interaction, it is also possible that the records from our times may also end up looking eerily similar to those of a Roman peasant- the only difference being an electronic version of  our records being maintained by another authoritarian entity.

But we can choose to widen our electronic participation more mindfully by creating digital footprints, not merely involuntarily and ignorantly leaving them behind. Beginning to do so will also maybe help one understand the aforementioned engine of the internet, why it feels permissionless in some ways and sensing the limits of this permissionless. As each of us works to seize a little more of the internet's limitless real estate, we may also begin a creative act of digital disobedience not too different from Thoreau's individualist form of a civilized disobedience while being that results in a personal legacy in the afterlife which future communities will dwell in.

[^1]: The degree to which this is true for my or my parents' generation can be debated but it is certainly true for my grandparents, none of whom had any form of internet presence. The memories of my grandparents will fade from history if I don't make a record of their existence. And that was because they did not maintain their own personal records beyond the government documentation.
