Take a look around you.\
10 years ago, is here where you imagined you’d be.\
10 years hence, is here where you will be\
and where will you take your last breaths?

I have never known where I was headed\
The flow took me along\
And I did not resist\
I did not go with the flow\
I just did not know\
That there was somewhere to go.

There are faces that we see right now\
But who knows what tomorrow brings\
Should we even make it there\
That’s how little I know of what will be\
Will be.
