- Vectran was used in making BEAM—it is not the only material but it is the restraint layer which bears at design pressures, which are usually a multiple (called factor of safety) of the operational pressure (14.7 psi for the ISS and other orbital habs).
- Now, Vectran's is five times stronger than steel and ten times stronger than aluminium while being half as dense (1400 $kg/m^3$) as aluminium.
- If made purely from Vectran, a 5000 $m^3$ [[Where is my von Braun Wheel?|von Braun wheel]] would need 7000 tons of Vectran—one such spaceship would require a crazy number of Starship launches: 70.
- Luckily, systems such as TransHab and [[BEAM video summary|BEAM]] are far less dense when inflated (synonymous with pressurised) as per the table below.

- So, a 5000 $m^3$ von Braun wheel made from TransHab materials would need only 2 Starship launches and 5 such launches, if made from BEAM-style materials.
- This helps frame the first challenge, which is:

> [!Challenge 1: Material Density Optimization]
  Find an optimised material that halves the pressurised density of TransHab materials so the mass fits within one Starship launch. Given that TransHab was less dense than BEAM, this doesn't sound as outrageous on paper.

### **Possible approaches:**
- **Lighter MMOD shielding:** MMOD was 68% of TransHab's mass in LEO, only 14% in deep space. While our chosen orbit is initially LEO—to take maximal mass to orbit using Starship—there may be need for in-orbit assembly of Whipple Shield panels around the restraint layer. If this is the case, then perhaps operating in a higher orbit might be preferable. The study should reveal this.
	- But the orbit won't be driven by the spaceship's engineering challenges alone—market demands of a large data center or robotic factory might show that their desired orbits are more lucrative than crewed spaceships in the near-term.
- **Advanced composites:** Carbon fiber restraint layers vs. Vectran/Kevlar.
- **Hybrid design:** More efficient hard-structure to soft-goods ratios.
## Packaged Density 
- BEAM's density when inflated is 88 $kg/m^3$ (from above table) and, assuming it's a cylinder when deflated too, it's density is 157 $kg/m^3$. TransHAB is even more impressive with a packaged/deflated/unpressurised density of 122 $kg/m^3$.
- This also tells us that the compression ratios (pressurised to unpressurized volumes) for TransHab and BEAM are 3.12 and 1.78, respectively.

> [!Challenge 2: Advanced Packaging]
> Identify a packaging method to fold said von Braun wheel into Starship's 1000 $m^3$ fairing. This is about finding a 5:1 ratio at the lower end, which might be insane before we consider 10:1 ratios (as unpressurised spaceship volumes might be of the same measure)?

## Materials
- Then there is the issue that the TransHab materials only scale to a certain diameter of about 8.2 $m$—a von Braun wheel of 75 $m$ diameter is unexplored territory but the graph suggests that novel restraint materials are needed beyond the 9 $m$ mark. This is where AI-led materials discovery will become crucial.
- The chart below shows design Categories by Complexity:
	- **Left side:** Simple bladder designs (small, low-load applications)
	- **Middle:** Combined restraint systems
	- **TransHab sits here:** "Bladder + Close Proximity Restraint" at ~20 ft diameter
- **Right side:** "Novel Restraint System" for very large structures (BA 2100)
