> When I meet a government which says to me, "Your money or your life," why should I be in haste to give it my money? It may be in a great strait, and not know what to do: I cannot help that. It must help itself; do as I do.

I sat with Thoreau's essay over the weekend- and as is par for my reading approach these days, I had Claude alongside in my book club[^5]. I was prompted to dust off Thoreau's Civil Disobedience from my bookshelf while trying to read  [Critical Art Ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Art_Ensemble)'s [Electronic Civil Disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_civil_disobedience)[^6]- something I sense will be far easier to read than Thoreau. In the pub, I was reminded of Gandhi's Civil Disobedience[^2] and wondered what the parallels it had with the Thoreauvian idea. [Stanford Plato's article on Civil Disobedience](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/civil-disobedience/) clarified that Thoreau's use of _civil_ does not imply _civility_ in one's acts of disobedience but to the disobedience of a [civil society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society) towards (unjust) government.

It is clear to me now that civility and non-violence is presumed in the Thoreauvian world-view as, very early in the essay, he makes clear both his anti-war posture[^1]  and identification as an abolitionist. In fact, these are the foundational reasons for his disagreement with the American government against whom he practices disobedience, finding their perpetuation of war and slavery as unconscionable. Elected governments cannot de facto be presumed as a just government merely because it is chosen by the majority- a strong position against democracy as it currently exists. His observation that a majority-elected ruling govt that does not protect its minority members (comprising slaves and abolitionists) but seeks to openly hurt them teases out this distinction between an unjust majority-elected democratic government from a moral one. The right decisions, Thoreau felt, are made by conscience and not by majority; anyone with a sense of what is good and right would not, after all, turn a blind eye to plight of slaves. Refusal to pay his taxes to an unjust government was Thoreau's demonstration of his conscience governing his decisions and actions.

> A corporation has no conscience; but a corporation of conscientious men is a corporation with a conscience.

One thing I found quite interesting was Thoreau stating that 1/6th of the population were chattel slaves[^7]. This means the demand for chattle slaves must have outstripped supply by a comfotable margin which challenged a general belief I held that my hunch that the number of slaces and owners would have been much closer than that on both sides[^8]. Another parallel thought I had was that the _majority of this majority group_ must have wanted and also had the means to acquire chattel slaves; without much research, I sense that this hints that wealth disparity might have been less stark back then compared to today[^4]. At minimum, I suspect that there might have been a healthier middle-class in Thoreau's time than we see in America today. Also, the wealth of the richest probably did not follow the power law. That said, I cannot fathom why today's dense concentration of wealth in the hands of a few individuals would be so unlikely in that period. Perhaps another way to think of this is that there are fewer super-rich people (by percentage) today than there were in Thoreau's times but today's small percentage of humans holds the vast percentage of total global wealth.

> I, Henry Thoreau, do not wish to be regarded as a member of any incorporated society which I have not joined

> Action from principle… is essentially revolutionary.

His action is an interesting one to contemplate today as individuals earning a wage, in most cases, cannot simply opt out of paying taxes (at least not in America or the West) though I imagine businesses and sole traders can, but I sense that is, again, a small number. For these reasons, people might find Thoreau's essay to be dated. But to this crowd, I countenance- why has the problem of the unjust government lingered? It is indisputable that this is this is the case for there are standing militaries and much fighting across states at the moment. And, much like in Thoreau's case, it is our taxes that enable this. The difference is that in Thoreau's times he withheld his taxes from the government but, in the case of us wagies, the taxes are withheld by the employers for the government. This is what Thoreau would say make us complicit in the atrocities of our governments, even if we disagree with it. Clearly, Thoreau's essay is timeless even if his strategy is not. A hundred years after Thoreau, it remained possible to execute a non-cooperative civil disobedience which, to me, means only one thing: that the technology of money had not yet been transformed and taxes had to be collected from the taxpayer, not withheld like it is today. I do wonder what a Thoreauvian civil disobedience might look like today though I think it’s fundamentally impossible to demonstrate your disagreement with your government in a non-cooperative and simultaneously non-violent manner.

> Those who, while they disapprove of the character and measures of a government, yield to it their allegiance and support are undoubtedly its most conscientious supporters, and so frequently the most serious obstacles to reform

Protests are a form of resistance but unaligned to Civil Disobedience. Thoreau is critical of organised protests for different reasons. His refusal to pay taxes was a form of protest not merely in opposition to government but also to every member of civil society that did not take a more thoughtful action- none moreso than those that paid his taxes to collector or for his release from prison. I have often also questioned the thoughtfulness of my protester friends who organise en masse to express their dismay while collectively participating in elections and tax-paying. Clearly they do not see this is perpetuating the idea that a central governance is needed and, by extension, so is an army.

If they do feel so strongly, then some new way to completely disengage from this machine must be invented by these individuals. For I do not share their view that protests in the town square are radical- in fact, these protests further justify government spending (and therefore collecting taxes) to maintaining a police force that keeps citizens in check. Especially protesters. If anything, protesters are playing into the hands of the system.

> Absolutely speaking, the more money, the less virtue.

==While the technology of money is one tingthing, our mass manipulation via digital media is another technology. What if we disengage from the latter; can it affect the former? recommendations to the individual to disengage digitally (even if they can’t stop paying taxes as we live in a digital era). ==

There are many quotables in the essay but none moreso than the above when it comes to timelessness. It rings especially true today, where we are seeing the emergence of an oligotechnodemocracy- a minority with technological power are majoriy elected into office; this is a neutral word in comparison to kleptocracy and oligarchy, which, I think, do not address the critical role of technology, especially the digital. This is the critical difference between our times from those of Gandhi or Thoreau. The digital money and media enables taxation before income. 

The emerging landscape of oligotechnodemocracy necessitates that we participate in some kind of a [[Digital Disobedience]]. But what is that exactly? Is it a disengagement from the digital? I see it as an eschewing of the engine of the “oligotechno“ that gets dubbed as technooptimis or more aptly as ”technocapitalism”. The machinemakers share offices with the government- something Thoreau didn't have to contend with: capitalism, where one could be wage slaves? Claude also drew the parallel to ancient slavers when we spoke here, saying that slavery was no racial and one could buy their freedom e.g., in Rome and Greece.


==But there’s also the matter of taxes- taxes being used to protect us with armies. But how is waging war a protective action? How about if we need protection, we invest in protecting ourselves from death/illness and from space threats like asteroids. And how about investing in growth of the human mind thru education, mindfulness, and space exploration technologies to spread the seed of the human soul.==

==It will also be about instructing government to offer us the kind of protection we need- with advanced technology, we can solve problems that govt couldn’t in theoreaus era. Let’s do that. Elimintate disrase, elimintate existential threats from climate and space, invest in growth of the mind and human flourishing in space.==

## Redirection of Govt Action
Early on, Thoreau speaks of standing armies as an insurance paid by public tax for governments to protect against a nation’s existential risk. Much of the expenditure of  Western governments  in is justified in this existential risk mindset. Historicaly, we see this in space research too: NASA funding dries up as we have moved away from the space race. But the moment that comes back into focus as an existential threat, we will start funding this again. 

Today, I hear of defensive actions to the existential threat posed by a lot. It is interesting that these are examples of things we create and then we perceive them as threats to ourselves. Humanity is thus an existential threat to itself? While one answer is to stop engineering dangerous things, the other answer is, perhaps, to be found from Thoreau's idea on conscience. Choose to do things with one's conscience and morality, which are undoubtedly robust qualitiative tools of decisionmaking than majority-led decisions. It is a choice to turn our inventions towards other and, by doing so, turning them on ourselves. 

There are also other existential risks that are not wholly of our making or are out of our control. Such as the asteorid which has a 2.4% chance of striking Earth by 2032. If we are so steadfastly committed to investing in defense, why not invest in a planetary defense system which brings all of our wartime capabilities to protect humanity in its entirety from existential risks.

Human health is another example where governments that take our taxes could focus. Perhaps, there is really no incentive for us to make people healthy but death is clearly an existential risk. Perhaps, this will only happen increase in lifespan not only addresses individual existential risk but national existential risk. So if people are healthier, then can fight in some kind of big war against another.

> He who gives himself entirely to his fellow men appears to them useless and selfish; but he who gives himself partially to them is pronounced a benefactor and philanthropist.”

> I have other affairs to attend to. I came into this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to live in, but to live in it.



[^1]: TIL, California and Texas were recent additions to the USA in the 1850’s, during the Mexican war. This also reminded me of the American precdents of buying land from other countries. This historical context makes the potential purchases of Greenland and Gaza being mooted by Trump seem less absurd.

[^2]: Thoreau's civil disobedience is an individual's practice whereas Gandhi's scales to groups. [Gandhi has also disputed being inspired by Thoreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyagraha#:~:text=The%20statement%20that%20I%20had%20derived%20my%20idea%20of%20civil%20disobedience%20from%20the%20writings%20of%20Thoreau%20is%20wrong.) but the shared principle of non-cooperation seems, to me, unquestionable.

[^4]: Bernie Sanders has been repeating during this recent election that the 3 richest have as much wealth as bottom half of all Americans. Claude tells me that this is fundamentally different from the wealth stratification of Thoreau's time. Even the wealthiest plantation owners or industrialists of the 1850s, while certainly very rich, didn't command anything close to this proportion of the nation's total wealth. This supports my intuition about the difference in distribution patterns- in Thoreau's time, while there was certainly inequality, wealth was distributed more gradually across different social strata.

[^5]: Claude is the second book club member- an involuntary one.

[^6]: I was in a pub but I quickly got side-tracked into a conversation with Claude which made me realise I must first read Thoreau before ECD.

[^7]: Chattel slavery is a specific form of slavery where people are treated as the personal property (or "chattel") of an owner and can be bought, sold, and inherited like any other piece of property. The term "chattel" comes from the medieval Latin "capitale," meaning property or capital.

[^8]: Now, I am wondering how much India's colonial history biases my interpretation of the world: in this case, I was using the the minority British dominating the majority Indian group as an analogue (and incorrectly at that)
