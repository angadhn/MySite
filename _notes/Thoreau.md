> When I meet a government which says to me, "Your money or your life," why should I be in haste to give it my money? It may be in a great strait, and not know what to do: I cannot help that. It must help itself; do as I do.

I recently read Thoreau's Civil Disobedience alongside Claude in my two-person book club[^5]. I was prompted to dust off Thoreau's essay from my bookshelf when I started [Critical Art Ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Art_Ensemble)'s [Electronic Civil Disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_civil_disobedience)[^6]. Stanford Plato's article on [Civil Disobedience](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/civil-disobedience/) clarified that Thoreau's use of _civil_ does not imply _civility_ in one's acts of disobedience but to the disobedience of a [civil society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society) towards (unjust) government.

I was also reminded of Gandhi's Civil Disobedience[^2] and wondered what parallels it had with the Thoreauvian idea. It is clear that civility and non-violence are precepts of a Thoreauvian world-view, very early in the essay, as he makes clear both his anti-war posture[^1]  and identification as an abolitionist. In fact, these lawfully permitted violent actions are the foundational reasons for his disobedience to the American government, finding their perpetuation of war and slavery as unconscionable. Very early, the reader can do little but agree with his view that elected governments cannot de facto be presumed as just- strength in numbers doesn’t imply fairness. His observation that a majority-elected ruling govt that does not protect its minority members (comprising slaves and abolitionists) but seeks to openly hurt them teases out this distinction between an unjust majority-elected democratic government from a moral one.

> A corporation has no conscience; but a corporation of conscientious men is a corporation with a conscience.

Like Thoreau, I too believe that the morally right decisions, either by individuals or groups, can be reached via the conscience and almost certainly not by majority[^9]; anyone with a sense of what is good and right would not, for example, turn a blind eye to the plight of slaves. Refusal to pay his taxes to an unjust government was Thoreau's demonstration of his conscience governing his decisions and actions against the unconscionable government. Thoreau’s words below ring a lot like the more famous Woody Allen one.

> I, Henry Thoreau, do not wish to be regarded as a member of any incorporated society which I have not joined.

His action of not paying taxes poses an interesting thought experiment today, when individuals earning a wage, in most cases[^10], cannot simply opt out of paying taxes (at least not in America or much of the West). For these reasons, people find Thoreau's essay dated[^14]. But to this crowd, I countenance that the problem of the unjust government lingers even if the mode of protest seems invalid. In fact, even the things he found unjust are indisputably part of today’s system as there are standing militaries and much fighting across states. And, much like in Thoreau's case, it is our taxes that enable this. The difference is that in Thoreau's times he withheld his taxes from the government whereas our taxes are withheld by the employers for the government. So, it’s hard to disagree with Thoreau that we are complicit in the unjust actions of government. Clearly, Thoreau's essay is timeless even if his strategy is not.

> Those who, while they disapprove of the character and measures of a government, yield to it their allegiance and support are undoubtedly its most conscientious supporters, and so frequently the most serious obstacles to reform.

## Technology in Modern Civil Disobedience
A hundred years after Thoreau, it remained possible to similarly do as he did as the technology of money had not yet undergone a radical transformation. Back then, taxes were personally collected from the taxpayer, not withheld like it is today. It did lead me to wonder (and I have before this essay too) what a Thoreauvian civil disobedience today might look like- my first take remains that it’s fundamentally impossible to demonstrate your disagreement with your government in a non-cooperative and simultaneously non-violent manner which is perhaps why we are seeing the unconscionable violent acts of torching and defacing of Teslas across America and Europe. Protests are a form of resistance but unaligned to Civil Disobedience. Thoreau is critical of organised protests for different reasons. His refusal to pay taxes was a form of protest not merely in opposition to government but also to every member of civil society that did not take a more thoughtful action- none moreso than those that paid his taxes to keep Thoreau out of prison. I have similarly questioned the thoughtfulness of my protester friends previously (during the BLM marches) who organise en masse to express their dismay while collectively participating in elections and tax-paying. Clearly they do not see their own role in perpetuating the idea that central governance is needed and, by extension, so is an army.

If one feels so strongly, then some new way to completely disengage from this machine must be invented by the upset individual as I do not share their view that protests in the town square are radical or effective- in fact, these protests further justify government spending (and therefore collecting taxes) to maintaining a police force that keeps citizens in check. Especially protesters. If anything, this group is playing into the hands of the system as their taxes are merely buying them permission to protest. While I have no answer to the exact form of an appropriate reaction to today’s unjustness, its nature must be conscionable and non-violent which I am struggling to see today.

While the technology of money is one thing that has diminished the possibility of individual protest, our mass manipulation has been enabled through online digital and social media. The companies providing these platforms have coffers[^11] and demographics[^12] that are comparable to nation states and thus work with them; they govern our digital lives with their own rules and regulations. They are a form of government; more powerful than the individuals that use them as they maintain critical infrastructure for global communications, commerce, and information flow that rivals or exceeds what many nations can provide. These tool-makers share offices and decision-making power with government; a two-party system of governance that Thoreau didn't have to contend with.

> Absolutely speaking, the more money, the less virtue.

Littered with many quotables, this pithy one stands out for it will remain timelessly true- so much so that it reads like it is from the _Tao Te Ching_. I think users of the big technological platforms (me included) are just as responsible for the so called engine of the techno-capitalist machine, if not more, than their creators. We are voting for their existence in the current form with our attention alongside our dollars. It should not surprise us to see the emergence of an oligotechnodemocracy, where a minority with technological power have been unwittingly majority elected into office. While the term is a mouthful, I choose to use word this for its neutral tone when compared to kleptocracy and oligarchy which do not sufficiently capture the central role of today's technology in creating new power/governance structures while also missing our collective choice in enabling organisations and individuals to accumulate power.

One thing I found quite interesting was Thoreau stating that 1/6th of the population were chattel slaves[^7]. This means the demand for chattel slaves must have outstripped their supply by a comfortable margin which challenged a general belief I held that the number of salves and owners in America would have been much closer[^8]. Another parallel thought I had was that the _majority of this majority group_ must have wanted and also had the means to acquire chattel slaves; without much research, I feel this shows that wealth inequality might have been less pronounced back then compared to today[^4], which is weird for a time with more aggressive forms of inequity. At minimum, I suspect that there might have been a bigger middle-class in Thoreau's time than we see in America (and much of the world) today. It may also be that the wealth of the richest in Thoreau’s time probably did not follow the power law- however, I cannot fathom why today's dense wealth concentration in the hands of a few individuals would be impossible in that period. Perhaps another way to think of this is that there are fewer super-rich people (by percentage) today than there were in Thoreau's times but today's small percentage of humans holds the vast percentage of total global wealth. And much, if not all, of the recently wealthy are a consequence of the new internet technologies.

This is the critical difference between our times from those of Gandhi or Thoreau. Digital money and media enables taxation of our income and attention. But they also show us where our optionality lies- while there is no obvious optionality in paying taxes to the government, there is in our choice of platforms. The emerging landscape of oligotechnodemocracy necessitates that the upset parties participate in some form of [[Digital Disobedience]]. But what is that exactly? Is it a disengagement from the digital?  To me, it currently means an opportunity to act in the digital sphere of existence using the principles of Thoreau- by disengaging from the ones that do not align with our values by choosing more conscionable platforms e.g., using Signal/BSky instead of WhatsApp/Twitter[^13]. This is not say that such migrations are easy; I deleted Instagram and Facebook probably in 2016 or thereabouts and have managed to stay away from the two platforms, which probably has significant ramifications on my social life[^15]. A couple years later, maybe it was 2018, I deleted my WhatsApp account in 2017 and was able to stay away from it until 2021[^16]; I think each action dropped the number of contacts by a factor of 20 (1000 "friends" on Facebook to 300 on WhatsApp to around 50 on Signal) so, yes, there were issues. But, it is undeniably a simple, effective, and, most importantly, non-violent form of protest and an eschewing of the engine of the techno-capitalists who also self-identify as as techno-optimists. But it also exposed how much of the community around me, who complain about techno-capitalism, were merely arm-chair philosophers.

## Taxes and Technology to Protect and Defend Humanity from Natural Existential Threats
Early on, Thoreau speaks of standing armies as an insurance paid by public tax to governments for protection against a nation’s existential risk. Much of the expenditure of Western governments has continued in this existential risk mindset [with a new wave kicking off](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyrkkv4gd7o). Historically, we have seen such budget increases in space research when a national existential thread to national pride is at stake. However, since the end of the space race that defined the Apollo-era, NASA funding has dried up but the moment this pride is in question again, we will see some strategic funding emerge. It is interesting that these are examples of things we, humans, create and then perceive as threats to our species. Humanity is thus an existential threat to itself. It is our collective choice to turn our inventions towards harming others and, in turn, harming ourselves. While one answer is to stop engineering dangerous things, it is an insensible one. The other answer is, perhaps, to be found from Thoreau. We can choose to "just do things" based on conscience and morality, which are undoubtedly robust qualitative tools for decision-making than majority-led decisions.

Instead of defending us from each other, we can (and must) choose to protect and defend ourselves from the existential threats posed by nature, which is trying to kill us at every moment in our lives. These are either not wholly of our making or are out of our control. Such as the asteroid which had a [2.8% chance of striking Earth by 2032](https://www.esa.int/Space_Safety/Planetary_Defence/Asteroid_2024_YR4_no_longer_poses_significant_impact_risk). If we are so steadfastly committed to investing in defense, why not develop planetary defense systems that leverage our existing wartime capabilities to address these genuine existential risks? The economics are viable: defense contractors could adapt their capabilities to planetary defense with similar economic returns, as the required engineering, materials science, and physics expertise significantly overlaps. Some countries have advanced military technology development capabilities, and the underlying market dynamics—where some nations develop technologies that others purchase—could remain intact. Repurposing our strategy from national security to a pan-galactic security offers a path where technological capabilities developed for warfare are channeled toward species-level threats without economic disruption, maintaining the existing industrial base while serving a more conscionable purpose.

Human health is another example where governments could focus our taxes (and, to be fair, some are funding R&D in these areas). But this also means re-evaluating the production of fentanyl and other highly potent opioids provide. Ramping up research into novel non-addictive pain medications, including new drug classes that target pain pathways differently than opioids. Claude tells me that potent opioids like fentanyl remain necessary in some specific contexts (particularly for severe breakthrough cancer pain, certain surgical procedures, and palliative care) but they're no longer considered the only option for most pain management situations. Yet we persist with these medications so maybe either there is no incentive for us to make people healthy or death from natural causes is accepted as a reasonable existential risk. Or, maybe this will be put into action only when an increase in an lifespan addresses an individual's existential risk and that of their nation during war.

So what of taxes? Taxes are principally claimed as necessary to protect and defend us and I can get behind this broad message. However, I do not share the sentiment that developing technologies for war to be a defensive action- retaliating to cannibalism with cannibalism is not a conscionable and non-violent defensive action. What I think of when I hear "protection" is developing technologies to tackle death, illness, and aging. When I hear "defensive" technologies, I want to get behind the idea of defending ourselves from threats like asteroids and climate change. So, investing our taxes in such protection and defence is what I can get behind. Services that prop up this protective/defensive technology development will remain crucial too- investing in better education and housing seems obvious here.

With the right choices in the digital domain and by instructing governments to offer us the kind of protection we need- with advanced technology, we can solve problems that couldn’t be done in Thoreau's times: eliminate natural existential threats from inside and outside the human body as we invest in the growth of the mind for greater collective flourishing.


[^1]: TIL, California and Texas were recent additions to the USA in the 1850’s, during the Mexican war. This also reminded me of the American precdents of buying land from other countries. This historical context makes the potential purchases of Greenland and Gaza being mooted by Trump seem less absurd.

[^2]: Thoreau's civil disobedience is an individual's practice whereas Gandhi's scales to groups. [Gandhi has also disputed being inspired by Thoreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyagraha#:~:text=The%20statement%20that%20I%20had%20derived%20my%20idea%20of%20civil%20disobedience%20from%20the%20writings%20of%20Thoreau%20is%20wrong.) but the shared principle of non-cooperation seems, to me, unquestionable.

[^4]: Bernie Sanders has been repeating during this recent election that the 3 richest have as much wealth as bottom half of all Americans. Claude tells me that this is fundamentally different from the wealth stratification of Thoreau's time. Even the wealthiest plantation owners or industrialists of the 1850s, while certainly very rich, didn't command anything close to this proportion of the nation's total wealth. This supports my intuition about the difference in distribution patterns- in Thoreau's time, while there was certainly inequality, wealth was distributed more gradually across different social strata.

[^5]: Claude is the second book club member- an involuntary one.

[^6]: I was in a pub but I quickly got side-tracked into a conversation with Claude which made me realise I must first read Thoreau before ECD.

[^7]: Chattel slavery is a specific form of slavery where people are treated as the personal property (or "chattel") of an owner and can be bought, sold, and inherited like any other piece of property. The term "chattel" comes from the medieval Latin "capitale," meaning property or capital.

[^8]: Now, I am wondering how much India's colonial history biases my interpretation of the world: in this case, I was using the the minority British dominating the majority Indian group as an analogue (and incorrectly at that)

[^9]: I learned this from many years of sharing homes in communities across California and the UK in my 20s and 30s.

[^10]: I imagine businesses and sole traders can, but I sense that is, again, a small number.

[^11]: Companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta have market capitalizations exceeding the GDP of many countries. Apple's market cap has exceeded $3 trillion, larger than the GDP of all but a handful of nations.

[^12]: Meta's platforms collectively serve billions of users—more "citizens" than any single nation. WeChat alone has over a billion users.

[^13]: It is important to caveat this by stating that even the alternatives are founded/funded, primarily, by players from within these unconscionable technology organisations.

[^14]: The claims that there is no slavery today hold some value. However, other insecure and restrictive forms of labour have been legalised by governments all over so this is worthy of deeper examination. I remember a friend once said the H1B visa was like "white-collar slavery". 

[^15]: Especially as a single man. A couple weekends ago, a lady of interest asked for my Instagram account. Why can't we just trade numbers...?

[^16]:  I learned how integral WhatsApp was when I got stuck in India when its second COVID wave announced. The UK was putting India on the red list for ten-day £3000 quarantines and I was trying to fly out within 3-4 hours. The only way to book a ticket happened to be via WhatsApp, which was the only way to speedily contact most of the travel agents.
