In 1962. There- that answers the clickbaity title right away.

NASA had viable designs for rotating wheel space stations that could have given astronauts artificial gravity. Then, the Apollo program effectively killed them.

While NASA's lunar focus delivered the historic moonshot, it dismantled a promising engineering effort at Langley Research Center that might have revolutionized human spaceflight. That decision set us on a half-century trajectory of small, zero-gravity stations that continue to plague astronauts with [muscle atrophy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-021-00158-4), [bone loss](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-020-0103-2), and [vision problems](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00654-7#:~:text=Spending%20long%20periods%20in%20the,that%20change%20how%20the%20eye).

Had NASA maintained its parallel pursuit of artificial gravity, we might now have permanent orbital settlements supporting deep space missions rather than the limited outposts we've settled for. This historical pivot point matters today as commercial space companies contemplate artificial gravity again, potentially correcting a costly detour in humanity's path to becoming a spacefaring civilisation.

## The need for artificial gravity
Early space visionaries, such as Werner von Braun, strongly believed that settling the solar system required developing technologies to generate artificial gravity within orbiting habitats as- rephrasing [Heinlein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress)- space is a harsh mistress. Modern-day astronauts [exercise a few hours each day](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/167746main_fs_livingandworkinginspace508c.pdf) to overcome [microgravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness)'s effects on [the body](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-020-0095-y). von Braun was convinced that rotating-wheel space stations prevented such physiological problems and were thus ['as inevitable as the rising sun’](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-stations/)”. In these systems, humans live along the periphery of a wheel, within which they experience gravity due to the wheel's rotation. Popularised by von Braun in his 1949 sci-fi novel, _[Project Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mars:_A_Technical_Tale)_, and the [1956 Disney piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JJL8CUfF-o), the concept actually traces back to [Herman Potočnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Poto%C4%8Dnik#The_Problem_of_Space_Travel)'s 1929 book [_The Problem of Space Travel_](https://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-QK9YC09U). Its legacy is perhaps why many felt that an operational spinning station was, at best, a couple decades away.

## The difficulty of building large stations
This elegant solution to generate artificial gravity, however, comes with a major engineering challenge. Much like a ferris wheel, the wheel's rotation could disorient astronauts if spun too fast. If the wheel spins slowly then its physics dictates it must be quite large. For example, one of von Braun's designs called for a massive 75 metre diameter wheel that generated lunar gravity if spun at 3 rpm and Earth-like gravity at 5 rpm- this range is considered [reasonable for astronauts](https://nss.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Space-Settlement-Population-Rotation-Tolerance-Globus.pdf).

However, the physics of rockets presents a different obstacle as it must be slender, like an arrow, to escapes earth's gravity well and reach orbit. This defines the main upstream engineering challenge: how can we fit enormous space structures into slender rockets? For context, even Starship's [upper-stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_(spacecraft)), which is about 9 metres wide and 22 metres tall cannot fit von Braun's conceptual station in a straightforward manner.

Architects of the International Space Station (ISS), the largest space structure ever built, tackled this packing problem using multiple smaller spacecraft which connect, like space Ikea, into a structure greater than its parts. Such in-space assembly involves spacecraft either gently crashing into each other at specific connection points (a manoeuvre called [rendezvous and docking](https://www.nasa.gov/reference/jsc-rendezvous-prox-ops-docking-subsystems/)) as well as [astronauts and space cranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Servicing_System) supporting finer assembly tasks. While this works great in theory, the ISS's assembly needed over 40 rocket launches spanning several years (and even more launches for cargo resupply and repairs). More damning is the typical ISS crew size of 7, which is a little over twice that of the first ever space station, Salyut, from 1972. Clearly 50 years of space station development does not indicate that such modular in-orbit assembly will scale to von Braun’s [anticipated 80 humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_wheel_space_station#:~:text=It%20was%20envisaged%20as%20having%20a%20crew%20of%C2%A080) or, more relevant today, Starship’s [100](https://www.spacex.com/media/starship_users_guide_v1.pdf) any time soon. Civilisation-scale megastructures like the Stanford Torus and O'Neill cylinders appear even more outlandish to discuss today than when they were first proposed in the 70s.

From today's vantage point, it is quite clear that the architectural bottleneck is a technology running through all operational space stations so far: their use of small 'tin can' modular spacecraft as the centrepiece for assembly, which is a legacy of Apollo. This, in my opinion, is unfit for building large space stations at scale or speed. But how did we get here? To understand this, we need to look into the pre-Apollo era space technology development programs and the consequence of Apollo's announcement on them.
## A pre-Apollo solution: unitised stations
From 1959 till 1962, NASA Langley explored various architectures to accelerate towards von Braun's vision enabled. A former Director of Aeronautical Research at NASA Langley, Larry Loftin, saw crewed stations as essential for manned exploration of the moon and planets following the success of Project Mercury. In keeping with this, he instigated a conference in 1959 to explore ideas at Langley, two of which were taken to the prototype stage. These early concepts are notable not only in their ambition in directly pursuing von Braun's vision but also for what now feels like a very counterintuitive way of realising large stations as "unitised" structures i.e., a single structure that eliminates or reduces the need for in-orbit assembly. An approach at odds with that used to assemble the ISS in-orbit, described above.

The first unitised station idea explored the inflating large tyre tubes (obviously made by Goodyear!) into wheel-shaped space stations- this is what James Webb, the then NASA Administrator, is standing under in the opening image of this essay; the image below shows engineers walking within this tube.
![source: https://archive.org/details/1962-L-00312](assets/imgs/1962-L-00312.jpg)

Made from soft materials, like rubber and nylon, there were concerns that collisions with micrometeorites could puncture the station with fatal outcomes. So, a six-month contract in 1961 was awarded to North American Aviation to look into hexagonal space stations, one of Rene Berglund's many station concepts, made from six hinge-connected rigid pipes. A 15-foot prototype of this system was developed, based on the table-top concept shown below.

![A deployable hexagonal space station  _source_: https://archive.org/details/1962-L-08732 ](assets/imgs/1962-L-08732.jpg)

![The deployable hexagonal space station. _source_: https://archive.org/details/1962-L-08730](assets/imgs/1962-L-08730.jpg)

This design folded neatly into a rocket for launch to later automatically deploy in-orbit; the rigidity of its habitable elements offered better protection to micrometeoroid collisions than Goodyear's rubber donut. Further, three inflatable tubes connected the habitats to a central hub via air-lock doors, which could be sealed in case of rupture. It was estimated that either system could be realised for $100 million (approximately a billion dollars in 2025) but, over time, the hexagonal station emerged as the most promising concept in Langley's Manned Space Laboratory Research Group. Space station R&D was one of the more active areas at Langley as NASA was unclear about the appropriate path to the moon and an orbiting station seemed like an appropriate purpose for crewed lunar and solar system exploration. Apollo would change everything- in May 1961, President Kennedy's landmark speech committed America to a lunar landing instead of the original plan to orbit the moon.
## The Apollo Applications Program: A Pivot Point
Apollo effectively sidelined the space station projects over the next years. The methodical approach of Loftin’s team to develop von Braun stations as a staging point for lunar missions was bypassed for more direct paths to the Moon. However, by 1963, the vision shrank dramatically to align with Apollo's more modest technologies: zero-gravity spacecraft for crews of three rather than the 36 envisioned for the rotating hexagon. The result was the Manned Orbiting Research Laboratory (MORL) program to conduct biomedical, scientific, and engineering experiments on a minimum size laboratory with one crew member staying in it for one year and three other crew members on board for shorter periods on a rotating schedule. Like the rotating wheel space station program, MORL was threatened by cuts but survived into 1965 only through Langley's persistent lobbying, which positioned larger stations as "the next logical step" after Apollo. 

Elsewhere, a parallel challenge was emerging within NASA's Marshall Space Flight where the Saturn rockets were being developed. Its head, Wernher von Braun knew that his rocket team would face layoffs sooner than other centers actively involved in other aspects of the first Moon landing. Its caused was an accelerated Saturn development plan problem by [George Mueller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mueller_(engineer), NASA's Associate Administrator and head of Office of Manned Space Flight, who championed the revolutionary "all-up testing". This is a risky approach where all stages of a rocket are flight-tested at once as opposed to testing each stage in dedicated flights. Mueller had previously seen this approach yield success in the Minuteman ICBM program, where missiles flew with all stages active on their very first test. This gamble to do so with larger space rockets paid off as Apollo 8 orbited the Moon on just the third Saturn V launch in December 1968.

But Mueller also understood the success's threat von Braun's team. Like Loftin and von Braun, Mueller was also a space station advocate and established a Saturn-[Apollo Applications Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Applications_Program#cite_ref-4) Office in 1965 as a step to addressing von Braun's staffing concerns while also preempting post-Apollo planning hurdles. This program would eventually fuse with Langley's early space station work; in 1967, the MORL concept was studied as an Earth-orbiting station that could also support a crewed Mars trip. In parallel, von Braun's Marshall center looked into two Earth-orbiting stations, one for astronomy and another for meteorology. Such studies went ahead only because of the interests of the two centers’ directors but lacked support from NASA Headquarters who didn’t see the alignment to Apollo.

This is evident from how follow-on budgets played out for Apollo Applications. Mueller had hoped to secure $450 million in 1967 and over $1 billion in FY 1968. Reality proved far harsher as the Bureau of the Budget slashed the FY 1967 request to a mere $42 million and the FY 1968 budget brought similar disappointments. Initial discussions between NASA and the Bureau of the Budget reduced the request from $626 million to $454 million. President Johnson endorsed this figure with an argument that would become familiar in subsequent years: "We have no alternative unless we wish to abandon the manned space capability we have created." But even with presidential support, Congress cut the authorization to $347 million, and NASA Administrator James Webb further reduced it by transferring funds to other activities. Mueller’s Apollo Applications was left with only $253 million. These severe budget constraints were paving the way to ensuring that no ambitious post-Apollo missions would happen.

Nonetheless these studies progressed. They looked into "wet" stations – a spent rocket stage that would first serve as a propulsive stage and then be converted into living quarters in orbit- and "dry” ones – a space station built on the ground and launched within a rocket. Mueller was convinced that the less complex dry station would be successful but required a Saturn V which James Webb was unwilling to spare. Webb had fought hard to convince Congress and the Bureau of the Budget that Apollo required the budget for at least 15 Saturn V vehicles. His reluctance to share a rocket is understandable as Mueller’s request was well before Apollo 8. Its early success made it increasingly likely that a Saturn V could be spared for Apollo Applications. Briefly, ideas for 75-100 person rotating wheel stations like the Space Base were considered in 1968 but eventually Skylab – America's first space station- would launch in 1973.

While significant in its own right, Skylab fell far short of the grand rotating wheel stations previously envisioned and used only a fraction of the Saturn V’s lifting power. Post-Apollo, NASA's funding shrank considerably, and the Space Shuttle became the "logical successor" to Apollo, with Skylab serving as a limited station based on Apollo technologies. It was clear that NASA would no longer pursue Apollo-style parallel programs but would pursue steps in their plan one by one. The Soviet Union, meanwhile, cooled their interest in their lunar program to launch Salyut, the first long-term space station program, which was followed up by the 1980s Mir stations, which was seen as quite similar to MORL.

The early ambitions displayed in Langley's inflatable torus and North American's hexagonal station now seem like relics of a more optimistic era – one where large crews would live comfortably in rotating structures that generated artificial gravity. The initial plans for these architectures were designed for repeatability and scale which could've led to greater scientific output than all stations so far while offering a deeper understanding of the impact of artificial gravity on human health- something unstudied to date.

This is probably a good time to note that I am quite critical of Apollo and it is also in fashion to NASA-bash right now. But, I do actually maintain the view that just like it’s better to have loved and lost than to not have loved at all, it’s also better to have Apollo’d and stopped than to never have Apollo’d at all. If one thinks of 1960s NASA as a presidential project to "put man on the Moon" then it easy to see it like one sees SpaceX- an organisation that excels at solving complex engineering challenges when given a focus, whether it was Apollo's lunar landings or the Space Shuttle's reusable orbiter development. This capability is perhaps best exemplified by JPL's remarkable track record with Mars missions: their evolution from early Viking landers to the sophisticated Curiosity and Perseverance rovers demonstrates an ability to build on experience and consistently execute challenging interplanetary missions. While other space agencies have struggled with Mars landings (like ESA's Beagle 2 and Russia's Mars 96), JPL has developed a repeatable expertise that makes the extraordinary seem routine. Their technologists pioneered a Martian landing technology that is now used to land SpaceX's rockets. So, the issue isn't NASA's engineering capability - it's about ensuring these formidable technical skills are directed toward the right long-term priorities for space development. And it’s about greeting a regulatory environment that allows more players to join in from all over the world by making ITAR a thing of the past.
## So will I ever get my Von Braun Wheel?

Possibly. The commercial potential for rotating space stations is gaining attention once again. Jed McCaleb of Vast, one of the fast-moving commercial players, echoes von Braun that space stations would be useful for Mars transport as they’d be '[much nicer to live on than inside Starship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj5NlK1_gFI&t=2150s)’ and [artificial gravity stations are essential for humans living in space beyond a year](https://youtu.be/jj5NlK1_gFI?si=l0drrn9R2DDHbW5g&t=2479). Starship's Mars transport could range from months to years, depending on when it launches.

At the moment, Vast is developing smaller 0-g Haven stations and their 2035 plan is for a long spinning stick station; think of it as a two-bladed fan. This is a step in the right direction but the limiting feature of their design is that any artificial gravity will only be at the very ends of the sticks. Also, their stations continue to build on the modular Apollo-era technologies, which I think is questionable. One way to imagine this is by looking at the plot below, which shows the volume per astronaut alongside the size of the station. Vast's 2035 plans will likely be less comfortable than the ISS if one uses volume per astronaut; but this metric is in itself worth of questioning as artificial gravity stations should make use of area per person, like we do on Earth. 
For the first time since the Saturn rockets, Starship offers an opportunity to refocus efforts to develop unitised large space structures, that extend beyond the concepts developed at Langley.

Langley's earlier work concluded rigid hexagonal stations were superior on account of the delicate nature of the inflatable fabric; this would require little new engineering research and is something that could be pursued in a 0-g scenario. At the same time, there is also need for research on inflatable soft goods. We’re mostly accustomed to living within rigid structures on Earth and so do not often think of lightweight, expandable living spaces made from textiles as a viable alternative. However, the inflatable toruses investigated by Langley were of minimal mechanical complexity and simplified construction. In the vacuum of space, textile-based structures could provide vast habitable areas with superior radiation shielding and thermal management. This insight is not particularly new as the [Bigelow Expandable Module (BEAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigelow_Expandable_Activity_Module), a small inflatable module on the ISS, has [proven stronger than the metallic modules](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas-Litteken/publication/333919095_System_Integration_Comparison_Between_Inflatable_and_Metallic_Spacecraft_Structures/links/5e75387392851cf2719a389c/System-Integration-Comparison-Between-Inflatable-and-Metallic-Spacecraft-Structures.pdf?__cf_chl_tk=pDGvn9SayN3u94_S2IxijTtcfUUkhKg0khQn23ldwPY-1735002576-1.0.1.1-tXvyxaLfG.lXVagYY.rMLfOHHkqRP9DP3HAh.jXshUY) to Micrometeoroids and Orbital Debris (MMOD) collisions and is just as safe from radiation. But, at 16 m³, it needs efforts into [discovering new high-strength soft materials](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas-Litteken/publication/333919095_System_Integration_Comparison_Between_Inflatable_and_Metallic_Spacecraft_Structures/links/5e75387392851cf2719a389c/System-Integration-Comparison-Between-Inflatable-and-Metallic-Spacecraft-Structures.pdf?__cf_chl_tk=pDGvn9SayN3u94_S2IxijTtcfUUkhKg0khQn23ldwPY-1735002576-1.0.1.1-tXvyxaLfG.lXVagYY.rMLfOHHkqRP9DP3HAh.jXshUY) to enable a 6000 m³  von Braun wheel. BEAM was a commercial effort that emerged from an early stage NASA program, [TransHAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransHab), in the 1990s. Now would be a good time to explore making even larger versions of such systems that converge toward artificial gravity stations. 

Then there is the matter of closing the business case for these stations. Almost all space station companies today believe they offer a platform to scale for startups like Varda and Space Forge [in-space manufacturing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj5NlK1_gFI&t=2138s). These companies are leveraging microgravity to produce better pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. This allows station manufacturers to first focus purely on deploying larger unitised volumes rapidly and leave the artificial gravity aspect for later in the roadmap; however, keeping the zero-g station's shape factor to later adapt to artificial gravity will better streamline efforts to support long-duration stays and interplanetary travel. All that said, it is completely likely that there is no near-term return on investment but it is a pill we must swallow while leveraging industrial capacity to push the frontiers of the possible. That is precisely the legacy of Apollo, to its credit.

Pursuing rotating space stations ideas would weave perfectly into the new tapestry for space exploration being stitched by Starship; the successor to the Saturn V needs engineering as ambitious Langley's in the 1960s.

# So what happened to these programs?

So, yes- this was quite an active period of commercial and NASA-led space station development. 1960’s NASA and today’s NASA are hamstrung in different ways. The Space Race era was about competition whereas today it is about cooperation. Competitions have proven to have short-term rewards that are hard to repeat; maybe it’s because they have incorrect targets or the wrong means to get to those targets or both. Apollo, an insane feat of engineering, probably had incorrect means because getting humans on the moon by 1970 while deprioritising a long-term reusable infrastructure like a space station doesn’t sit right. Especially when we haven’t gone back in 50 years but also because more progress was made by 1961 on the idea of large stations as platforms for routine and repeatable access to the Moon or Mars.

OTOH. Cooperation comes with coordination costs; for example, coordination between NASA, ESA, JAXA, Roscosmos gave an impressive ISS but underperforms as a research lab (tho I will say it is better than having nothing) and took a long time to build and has issues affected by the politics of the day. It’s not easy to build another ISS- let alone a bigger one- and also isn’t a platform for launching deep space missions (e.g., it has never been used as a staging platform for any Martian missions).  

So why does an org like SpaceX seem to work? Elon is a clear reason but also sometgin common to companies is the internal collaboration culture (which is more fluid than cooperation, ). This means coordination costs are low and paperwork/processes are also minimised. These systems are better at course correction- something govt orgs won’t typically do (maybe they can’t?). NASA’s Space Launch System is a terrific example of not course correcting.  

Today, [ITAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations) has a pretty massive impact on both NASA and SpaceX; America basically uses it to regulate who can and cannot work in the US space sector. This Elon reply (and the thread before the reply) are pretty good at summarising ITAR: [https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1695002550251213268](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1695002550251213268)

That said, it is in fashion to bash NASA right now. But I would like to remind readers that NASA excels at solving complex engineering challenges when given a clear mission focus- whether it was Apollo's lunar landings or the Space Shuttle's reusable orbiter development. This capability is perhaps best exemplified by JPL's remarkable track record with Mars missions: their evolution from early Viking landers to the sophisticated Curiosity and Perseverance rovers demonstrates an ability to build on experience and consistently execute challenging interplanetary missions. While other space agencies have struggled with Mars landings (like ESA's Beagle 2 and Russia's Mars 96), JPL has developed a repeatable expertise that makes the extraordinary seem routine. Their technologists pioneered a Martian landing technology that is now used to land SpaceX's rockets. So, the issue isn't NASA's engineering capability - it's about ensuring these formidable technical skills are directed toward the right long-term priorities for space development. And it’s about greeting a regulatory environment that allows more players to join in from all over the world by making ITAR a thing of the past.
