In 1962. There — that answers the clickbaity title right away.

NASA had viable designs for rotating wheel space stations that could have given astronauts artificial gravity. Then, the Apollo program effectively killed them.

While NASA's lunar focus delivered the historic moonshot, it dismantled a promising engineering effort at Langley Research Center that might have revolutionized human spaceflight. That decision set us on a half-century trajectory of small, zero-gravity stations that continue to plague astronauts with [muscle atrophy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-021-00158-4), [bone loss](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-020-0103-2), and [vision problems](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00654-7#:~:text=Spending%20long%20periods%20in%20the,that%20change%20how%20the%20eye).

Had NASA maintained its parallel pursuit of artificial gravity, we might now have permanent orbital settlements supporting deep space missions rather than the limited outposts we've settled for. This historical pivot point matters today as commercial space companies contemplate artificial gravity again, potentially correcting a costly detour in humanity's path to becoming a spacefaring civilisation.

## The need for artificial gravity
Early space visionaries, such as Werner von Braun, strongly believed that settling the solar system required developing technologies to generate artificial gravity within orbiting habitats as — rephrasing [Heinlein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress) — space is a harsh mistress. Modern-day astronauts [exercise a few hours each day](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/167746main_fs_livingandworkinginspace508c.pdf) to overcome [microgravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness)'s effects on [the body](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-020-0095-y). von Braun was convinced that rotating wheel space stations prevented such physiological problems and were thus ['as inevitable as the rising sun’](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-stations/)”. In these systems, humans live along the periphery of a wheel, within which they experience gravity due to the wheel's rotation. Popularised by von Braun in his 1949 sci-fi novel, _[Project Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mars:_A_Technical_Tale)_, and the [1956 Disney piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JJL8CUfF-o), the concept actually traces back to [Herman Potočnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Poto%C4%8Dnik#The_Problem_of_Space_Travel)'s 1929 book [_The Problem of Space Travel_](https://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-QK9YC09U). Its legacy is perhaps why many felt that an operational spinning station was, at best, a couple decades away.

## The difficulty of building large stations
This elegant solution to generate artificial gravity, however, comes with a major engineering challenge. Much like a ferris wheel, the wheel's rotation could disorient astronauts if spun too fast. If the wheel spins slowly then its physics dictates it must be quite large. For example, one of von Braun's designs called for a massive 75 metre diameter wheel that generated lunar gravity if spun at 3 rpm and Earth-like gravity at 5 rpm — this range is considered [reasonable for astronauts](https://nss.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Space-Settlement-Population-Rotation-Tolerance-Globus.pdf).

However, the physics of rockets presents a different obstacle as it must be slender, like an arrow, to escape Earth's gravity well and reach orbit. This defines the main upstream engineering challenge: how can we fit enormous space structures into slender rockets? For context, even Starship's [upper-stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_(spacecraft)), which is about 9 metres wide and 22 metres tall cannot fit von Braun's conceptual station in a straightforward manner.

Architects of the International Space Station (ISS), the largest space structure ever built, tackled a similar packing problem using multiple smaller spacecraft which connect, like space Ikea, into a structure greater than its parts. Such in-space assembly involves spacecraft either gently crashing into each other at specific connection points (a manoeuvre called [rendezvous and docking](https://www.nasa.gov/reference/jsc-rendezvous-prox-ops-docking-subsystems/)) as well as [astronauts and space cranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Servicing_System) supporting finer assembly tasks. While this works great in theory, the ISS's assembly needed over 40 rocket launches spanning several years (and even more launches for cargo resupply and repairs). More damning is the typical ISS crew size of 7, which is a little over twice that of the first ever space station, Salyut, from 1972. Clearly 50 years of space station development does not indicate that such modular in-orbit assembly will scale to von Braun’s [anticipated 80 humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_wheel_space_station#:~:text=It%20was%20envisaged%20as%20having%20a%20crew%20of%C2%A080) or, more relevant today, Starship’s [100](https://www.spacex.com/media/starship_users_guide_v1.pdf) any time soon. Civilisation-scale megastructures like the Stanford Torus and O'Neill cylinders appear even more outlandish to discuss today than when they were first proposed in the 70s.

From this vantage point, it is quite clear that the architectural bottleneck is a technology running through all operational space stations so far: their use of small 'tin can' modular spacecraft as the centrepiece for assembly, which is a legacy of Apollo. This, in my opinion, is unfit for building large space stations at scale or speed. But how did we get here? To understand this, we need to look into the pre-Apollo era space technology development programs and the consequence of Apollo's announcement on them.
## A pre-Apollo solution: unitised stations
From 1959 till 1962, NASA Langley explored various architectures to accelerate towards von Braun's vision. A former Director of Aeronautical Research at NASA Langley, Larry Loftin, saw these stations as essential to crewed exploration of our Moon and planets following the success of Project Mercury. In keeping with this, he instigated a conference in 1959 to explore ideas at Langley, two of which were taken to the prototype stage. These early concepts are notable not only for their ambition in directly pursuing von Braun's vision but also for what now feels like a very counterintuitive way of realising large stations as "unitised" structures i.e., a single structure that eliminates or reduces the need for in-orbit assembly. An approach at odds with the space IKEA philosophy used to assemble the ISS in-orbit.

The first unitised station idea explored inflating large tyre tubes (obviously made by Goodyear!) into wheel-shaped space stations — this is what James Webb, the then NASA Administrator, is standing under in the opening image of this essay; the image below shows engineers walking within this tube.
![Engineers walking inside the Goodyear torus. source: https://archive.org/details/1962-L-00312](assets/imgs/WiP1/1962-L-00312.jpg)

Made from soft materials, like rubber and nylon, there were concerns that collisions with micrometeorites could puncture the station with fatal outcomes. So, a six-month contract was awarded in 1961 to North American Aviation to look into hexagonal space stations, one of Rene Berglund's many station concepts, made from six hinge-connected rigid pipes. A 15-foot prototype of this system was developed, based on the table-top concept shown below.

![The packed version of the North American deployable hexagonal space station  _source_: https://archive.org/details/1962-L-08732](assets/imgs/WiP1/1962-L-08732.jpg)

![The hexagonal space station when fully deployed. _source_: https://archive.org/details/1962-L-08730](assets/imgs/WiP1/1962-L-08730.jpg)

This design also folded neatly into a rocket for launch to later deploy in-orbit automatically; the rigidity of its habitable elements also ensured better protection to micrometeorite collisions than Goodyear's rubber donut. Further, another three inflatable pipes connected the rigid peripheral habitats to a central hub via air-lock doors, which could be sealed in case of rupture. Loftin’s Langley team estimated that either system could be realised for $100 million (approximately a billion dollars in 2025) but, over time, the hexagonal station emerged as the most promising concept in Langley's Manned Space Laboratory Research Group.

Space station R&D was one of the more active areas at Langley as NASA was unclear about the appropriate path to the moon and an orbiting station seemed like an appropriate precursor to crewed lunar and solar system exploration. Apollo would change everything — in May 1961, President Kennedy's landmark speech committed America to a lunar landing instead of the original plan to merely orbit the moon.
## The Apollo Applications Program: A Pivot Point

The Langley team's grand vision for artificial gravity space stations was systematically sidelined by Apollo program priorities, budget constraints, and shifting administrative focus (especially post-Apollo). This transformation represents a critical inflection point in space development: a move from ambitious long-term planning to pragmatic incrementalism that continues to shape space exploration today.

The early 1960s marked a dramatic pivot away from NASA Langley's methodical approach of developing von Braun wheels as lunar mission staging points. Instead, NASA adopted more direct paths to the Moon under Apollo's mandate. By 1963, the grand rotating hexagon designed for 36 crew members was replaced by the more modest Manned Orbiting Research Laboratory program — a zero-gravity facility for a crew of four focused on conducting basic biomedical and engineering experiments. Like its predecessors, this program was also threatened by cuts but survived into 1965 only through Langley leadership's persistent lobbying — which positioned larger stations as "the next logical step" after Apollo — to eventually become part of [George Muelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mueller_\(engineer\))r’s Saturn-[Apollo Applications Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Applications_Program#cite_ref-4) Office.

Mueller, who was NASA's Associate Administrator and head of the Office of Manned Space Flight, was not just a champion of space stations but also a shrewd leader. With a background in military missile testing, he had accelerated the development of the ‘Saturn V’ with the ‘all-up testing’ method. This led to Apollo 8’s success well ahead of schedule.

But this created a problem of layoffs in von Braun’s rocket team at Marshall Space Flight Center sooner than expected. Apollo Applications was one way of addressing this problem while simultaneously preempting post-Apollo planning hurdles. As part of this program, the teams at Marshall and Langley produced multiple new station concepts including a potential platform for crewed Mars missions and specialised Earth-orbiting stations for astronomy and meteorology. But this work would be short lived as Mueller's hope for over $1.5 billion in funding for Apollo Applications by 1968 was rebuffed by NASA Headquarters and the Bureau of Budget. He  ultimately received only $300 million (equivalent to approximately $2.7 billion in 2025), which effectively eliminated the possibility of ambitious post-Apollo missions.

The competition for Saturn V rockets further limited station development. NASA Administrator James Webb, having fought to secure funding for 15 Saturn V vehicles to accomplish Apollo's goals, was initially unwilling to allocate any for space station deployment. Only after Apollo 8's unexpected early success did the possibility emerge of sparing a Saturn V for non-Apollo reasons. So, ambitious ideas for 75-100 person rotating wheel stations, called the Space Base, again briefly sprouted.

Eventually Skylab — America's first space station — would launch in 1973 on the last ever Saturn V launch. It fell far short of the grand rotating wheel stations previously envisioned and utilized only a fraction of the Saturn V's lifting capacity. It was an embodiment of the shrinking visions to come.

Post-Apollo, NASA dropped the parallelised program strategy instead adopting an incremental approach to space development. As a result, the Space Shuttle became the 'logical successor' and parallel pursuits of ambitious space station programs were abandoned. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union, having shifted focus from lunar landings, launched their Salyut program followed by Mir—conceptually similar to NASA's scaled-down Manned Orbiting Research Laboratory rather than the ambitious rotating stations.

The early visions of large crews living in rotating structures with artificial gravity now appear as relics relegated to a more optimistic era—one where space architecture was designed for repeatability and scale that could have yielded greater scientific output while answering fundamental questions about artificial gravity's effects on human health that remain unstudied to this day.

This is probably a good time to note that I am quite critical of Apollo and it is also in fashion to NASA-bash right now. But, I do actually maintain the view that just like it’s better to have loved and lost than to not have loved at all, it’s also better to have Apollo’d and stopped than to never have Apollo’d at all.

If one thinks of 1960s NASA as a presidential project to "put man on the Moon" then it's easy to compare it to SpaceX — an organisation that excels at solving complex engineering challenges when given a focus, whether it was Apollo's lunar landings or the Space Shuttle's reusable orbiter development. More recently, this capability is perhaps best exemplified by JPL's remarkable track record with Mars missions: their evolution from early Viking landers to the sophisticated Curiosity and Perseverance rovers demonstrates an ability to build on experience and consistently execute challenging interplanetary missions.

While other space agencies have struggled with Mars landings (like ESA's [Beagle 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle_2) and their joint effort with Russia on [Schiaparelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiaparelli_EDM)), JPL has developed a repeatable expertise that makes the extraordinary seem routine albeit at high cost. Their technologists pioneered a Martian landing technology that is now used to land SpaceX's rockets. So, the issue isn't NASA's engineering capability — it's about ensuring these formidable technical skills are directed toward the right long-term priorities for space development and are done cost-effectively with shorter development cycles. And it’s about greeting a regulatory environment that allows more players to join such efforts from all over the world by making [ITAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations) a thing of the past.
## So will I ever get my Von Braun Wheel?

Possibly. The commercial potential for rotating space stations is gaining attention once again. Jed McCaleb of Vast, one of the fast-moving commercial players, echoes von Braun that space stations would be useful for Mars transport as they’d be '[much nicer to live on than inside Starship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj5NlK1_gFI&t=2150s)’ and [artificial gravity stations are essential for humans living in space beyond a year](https://youtu.be/jj5NlK1_gFI?si=l0drrn9R2DDHbW5g&t=2479). Starship's Mars transport could range from months to years, depending on when it launches.

At the moment, Vast is developing the smaller zero-g [Haven](https://www.vastspace.com/haven-1) [stations](https://www.vastspace.com/haven-2) and their [2035 plan](https://www.vastspace.com/roadmap#:~:text=2035%3A%20Artificial%20Gravity%C2%A0Station) is for an artificial gravity station shaped like a long stick, which spins like a two-bladed fan to create gravity at the ends of the stick. This is a step in the right direction but the limiting feature of their design is that gravity is only be at the very ends of the sticks, which would be a small space to cram a bunch of astronauts into. Also, their stations continue to follow the modular philosophy of the Apollo-era, which I think is questionable for scaling to large stations.

One way to understand my skepticism is by looking at the plot below, which shows the average station volume per astronaut alongside its crew capacity. Vast's 2035 plans will likely be less comfortable than the ISS if one uses this metric of volume per astronaut; it's also well short of the von Braun and Space Base station concepts of the 60s. However, this occupancy metric is also worthy of questioning as artificial gravity stations should make use of area per person — like we do on Earth — and not volume. Yet, all space station documentation has focused purely on volume. Further, this metric also tells us why the Stanford Torus and O'Neill Cylinders are megastructures that might be too distracting for now as they are too far removed from other artificial gravity stations. There are probably a number of other reasonable conceptual stations in this design space that should be explored (Note that I have omitted several ideas in this plot as it is not meant to be exhaustive).

Langley's earlier work concluded rigid hexagonal stations were superior on account of the delicate nature of the inflatable fabric; this would require little new engineering research and is something that could be pursued in a 0-g scenario. At the same time, there is also need for research on inflatable soft goods. We’re mostly accustomed to living within rigid structures on Earth and so do not often think of lightweight, expandable living spaces made from textiles as a viable alternative. However, the inflatable toruses investigated by Langley were of minimal mechanical complexity and simplified construction. In the vacuum of space, textile-based structures could provide vast habitable areas with superior radiation shielding and thermal management. This insight is not particularly new as the [Bigelow Expandable Module (BEAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigelow_Expandable_Activity_Module), a small inflatable module currently on the ISS, has [proven stronger than the metallic modules](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas-Litteken/publication/333919095_System_Integration_Comparison_Between_Inflatable_and_Metallic_Spacecraft_Structures/links/5e75387392851cf2719a389c/System-Integration-Comparison-Between-Inflatable-and-Metallic-Spacecraft-Structures.pdf?__cf_chl_tk=pDGvn9SayN3u94_S2IxijTtcfUUkhKg0khQn23ldwPY-1735002576-1.0.1.1-tXvyxaLfG.lXVagYY.rMLfOHHkqRP9DP3HAh.jXshUY) to micrometeorites and orbital debris collisions while being just as safe from radiation. BEAM was a commercial effort resulting from an early stage NASA program, [TransHAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransHab), in the 1990s. But, at 16 m³, new efforts are needed into [discovering and developing new high-strength soft materials](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas-Litteken/publication/333919095_System_Integration_Comparison_Between_Inflatable_and_Metallic_Spacecraft_Structures/links/5e75387392851cf2719a389c/System-Integration-Comparison-Between-Inflatable-and-Metallic-Spacecraft-Structures.pdf?__cf_chl_tk=pDGvn9SayN3u94_S2IxijTtcfUUkhKg0khQn23ldwPY-1735002576-1.0.1.1-tXvyxaLfG.lXVagYY.rMLfOHHkqRP9DP3HAh.jXshUY) to enable a 6000 m³ von Braun wheel. Now would be a good time to explore making even larger versions of such systems that converge toward artificial gravity stations. 

Then there is the matter of closing the business case for any station. Almost all space station companies today believe they offer a platform to scale [in-space manufacturing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj5NlK1_gFI&t=2138s) for startups like Varda and Space Forge. These companies are leveraging microgravity to produce better pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. This means there is no immediate need for artificial gravity, allowing station manufacturers to first focus purely on deploying larger unitised volumes rapidly. Artificial gravity can be addressed later in the roadmap; however, working with a station geometry that can later adapt to artificial gravity will better streamline subsequent efforts to support long-duration stays and interplanetary travel. This is a huge issue with the ISS design — it can’t just become a spinning station that offers some artificial gravity.

That said, it is completely likely that there is no near-term return on investment on a space station. This is a bitter pill we must swallow while seeing their development as an opportunity to expand on existing industrial capacity that pushes the frontiers of the possible. That is precisely the legacy of Apollo to its credit.

For the first time since the Saturn rockets, we have a launcher– Starship – that offers an opportunity to once again develop unitised large space structures that extend beyond the concepts in Langley’s archives. Pursuing rotating space stations would weave perfectly into the new tapestry for space exploration being stitched by Starship; the successor to the Saturn V needs engineering as ambitious as Langley's in the 1960s.
