Breaking with clickbait-y writing wisdom, I'll start with the answer for the impatient ones familiar with the von Braun wheel concept: it is in 1961. Or 1962. Buried in the archival memories of NASA Langley, alongside [many other great projects undertaken there](https://angadh.com/translation/hungarianarticleaboutnasa).

But for the rest of you, dear readers, I will describe our early attempts at building these artificial gravity space stations, why we ended up of with a similar family of zero-gravity space stations, and how we might course-correct towards widespread intergalactic intelligence imagined by Isaac Asimov and Douglas Adams.

# What is a vBW?
Rephrasing [Heinlein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress), we know today that space is a harsh mistress. Alongside high radiation, the near zero gravity of [Low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit) severely impacts [human health](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-020-0095-y) leading to [muscle atrophy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-021-00158-4), [bone loss](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-020-0103-2), and [vision problems](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00654-7#:~:text=Spending%20long%20periods%20in%20the,that%20change%20how%20the%20eye). Modern-day astronauts spend [a few hours each day exercising](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/167746main_fs_livingandworkinginspace508c.pdf) to overcome some of these issues. For this reason, early space visionaries, such as Werner von Braun, strongly believed that settling the solar system required developing technologies to generate artificial gravity within orbiting habitats.

von Braun believed his technological solution - the rotating-wheel space station - was ['as inevitable as the rising sun’](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-stations/). In his 1949 sci-fi novel, “[Project Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mars:_A_Technical_Tale)”, humans reached the red planet using such stations and, in 1956, Disney worked with him to create the first visuals of this “[von Braun wheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JJL8CUfF-o)” , shown in the image below. In such systems, humans live along the periphery of a spinning wheel, within which they experience gravity while there is none at the wheel's hub. As the space race picked up, many felt we were a couple decades away from living these visions.

This elegant solution to generate artificial gravity, however, comes with a major engineering challenge. The gravity along the wheel is generated by rotating it and, like ferris wheels, motion sickness in astronauts is prevent by spinning the station at low speeds. The resulting physics then dictates that these wheels be quite large. For example, one of von Braun's designs called for a massive 250-foot diameter wheel that generated lunar gravity if spun at 3 rpm and Earth-like gravity at 5 rpm, which are considered as [safe speeds to avoid disorientation among astronauts](https://nss.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Space-Settlement-Population-Rotation-Tolerance-Globus.pdf). However, the physics of rockets requires they be slender, like arrows, to escape earth's gravity well. For context, Starship's [upper-stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_(spacecraft)) is about 9 metres wide and 22 metres tall with most launchers being far smaller. This defines the main upstream engineering challenge: how can we fit such enormous space stations into slender rockets?

# Challenge: Building large stations
Architects of the International Space Station (ISS), the largest largest space structure ever built, have solved this packing problem using a modular construction approach. Here, multiple smaller spacecraft combine, like space Lego, into a structure greater than its parts. This construction strategy, called in-orbit assembly, involves spacecraft gently crashing into each other using [rendezvous and docking](https://www.nasa.gov/reference/jsc-rendezvous-prox-ops-docking-subsystems/) as well as [astronauts and space cranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Servicing_System) for finer assembly tasks. While this works great in theory, the ISS's assembly needed over 40 rocket launches over several years (and even more launches for cargo resupply and repairs). More damning is it typically has a crew of 7, which is only a little over twice as much as the first ever space station, Salyut, flown in 1972. Such numbers are a far-cry from von Braun’s [anticipated station crew of 80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_wheel_space_station#:~:text=It%20was%20envisaged%20as%20having%20a%20crew%20of%C2%A080) or, more interestingly, Starship’s [more recent expectations of 100 people](https://www.spacex.com/media/starship_users_guide_v1.pdf).

Looking at every space station so far, one sees a common technological thread running through each of them. The use of 'tin can' spacecraft engineering, a legacy bequeathed from the Apollo missions to modern space station design which, in my opinion, is unfit for building large space stations for hundreds. Further, none of these stations have ever addressed the generation of artificial gravity.  Clearly, in-orbit assembly hasn't gotten us any closer to von Braun's vision but, more damningly, hasn't proven to scale effectively or rapidly. In other words, the ISS and everything before it is the opposite of “faster, cheaper, better”. So, if it's such a bad idea, how did we get here? To understand this, we have to look at the technology development programs in the pre-Apollo era and how political focus on the Moon kept taking us off track.

Given all that we know about building space stations today, it would be natural to assume that building them from rigid, metallic modules was always the foundational idea. Yet from 1958 till 1961, NASA Langley pursued far more radical ideas to making artificial gravity stations. They built on the traction of von Braun's vision to explore two radically different architectures. The first explored the use of large tyre tubes (obviously made by Goodyear!) that inflate into wheel-shaped space stations- this is what James Webb is standing under in the first image of this essay and the image below shows engineers walking within this human-scale tube. Made from soft materials, like rubber and nylon, there were concerns that collisions with micrometeorites could puncture the station and be fatal to astronaut life.

So, North American Aviation was looking into another idea, that of a hexagonal space station made from hinge-connected rigid links. This station could fold neatly into a rocket for launch to later deploy in-orbit. The rigid habitable elements would offer better protection to micrometeoroid collisions than Goodyear's rubber donut. A 15-foot prototype of the system was developed based on the table-top concept shown below.

Perhaps a line of research would have been initiated in 1961- we will never know. Soon after Apollo was announced by Kennedy, cancellation threats were issued to the ongoing space station development projects which had little relevance to landing man on the Moon in 8 years. The program survived through Langley’s leadership lobbying who convinced NASA HQ that larger stations were a logical successor to Apollo. The space station vision shrank to meet Apollo’s more modest needs: no artificial gravity and much smaller crews of 3. Post-Apollo era, NASA’s funding shrank and the Space Shuttle became the “logical successor” with a very limited station, Skylab, was launched based on Apollo technologies. The Soviet Union also cooled their interest in their lunar programme and started Salyut, the first serious space station programme.

These early concepts are notable not only in their ambition in directly pursuing von Braun's vision but also for what now feels like a very counterintuitive way of realising large stations as "unitised" structures i.e., a single structures that avoids or reduces needing in-orbit assembly. The initial plans for these architectures were designed for repeatability and scale which would leade to greater scientific output than all stations so far while offering a deeper understanding of the impact of artificial gravity on human health. We might even had several orbiting settlements distributed across the Solar System by now, taking us closer to an Asimovian future or that of Philip K. Dick's imagination of Mars settlements in _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_
