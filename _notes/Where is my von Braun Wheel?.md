Breaking with clickbait-y writing wisdom, I start with the answer for the impatient few who are familiar with the von Braun wheel concept: it is in 1961. Or 1962. And now they are buried in the archives of NASA Langley, alongside [many other great projects undertaken there](https://angadh.com/translation/hungarianarticleaboutnasa).

But for the rest of you, dear readers, I describe our early attempts at building artificial gravity space stations, why we ended up with a different class of space station, and how we might return to focusing on them if we are to achieve the space-faring futures and robotic Mars colonies that are the foundations of Isaac Asimov and Philip K Dick.

# What is a vBW?
Alongside the high radiation in space, the lack of Earth's gravity has long been known to severely impact human health which leads to muscle atrophy, bone loss, and vision problems. It was obvious to early space visionaries that settling the solar system requires developing technologies to generate artificial gravity. In his 1949 sci-fi novel, “[Project Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mars:_A_Technical_Tale)”, a wheel-shaped rotating space station brought humans to the red planet. In 1956, Disney collaborated with him to create visuals of this “[von Braun wheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JJL8CUfF-o)”, thinking they would be a part of our reality within a few decades. von Braun believed his solution - the rotating-wheel space station - was ['as inevitable as the rising sun’](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-stations/) because its rotation creates an artificial gravity. In such wheels, gravity is zero at the centre but increases as you go further away from it. Locating the habitat along the wheel's circumference at a sufficient distance from the centre would mitigate the aforementioned zero gravity-induced issues.

This elegant solution, however, comes with its own engineering challenges. Rotating space stations must be quite large to avoid inducing motion sickness among inhabitants. If made too small and spun too quickly, the Coriolis effect would disorient occupants. To address this limitation, von Braun's design featured a massive 250-foot diameter wheel, which could generate lunar gravity when spinning at 3 rpm and Earth-like gravity at 5 rpm. However, the upstream challenge to such large space stations is how we can fit them into a launch vehicle; for context, SpaceX's Starship contains its satellites in a cylinder of about 9 metres wide and 22 metres tall.

==[While these rates are thought to be within safe ranges](https://nss.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Space-Settlement-Population-Rotation-Tolerance-Globus.pdf), long-term human tests in orbit are needed for confirmation.==

==So can we create such large stations when rockets are nowhere near large enough? Have we tried to make them? Could they have other uses prior to becoming stations for deep space human exploration? I'll try to unpack these questions, somewhat systematically.==
# Have we tried to make them? Yes. What is 
*he* challenge and bottleneck? We have but rockets must be shaped a certain way so space stations need to be packed into them.

Today, the largest largest space structure ever built, the International Space Station (ISS), is home to 7 astronauts free-falling in a near zero-gravity environment. Through it, and all realised stations (past and present), runs a common technological thread: their use of small rigid, metallic habitation modules. These are a legacy bequeathed from the Apollo Era to modern space station design which, in my opinion, are unfit to realising truly large space stations. Let me explain why this was a bad idea and how it happened.

Why a bad idea? The aerodynamics of rockets requires that they be slender, like an arrow, to escape earth's gravity well. For context, Starship is 9 m wide so creating a 150 m large ISS has required other approaches. To overcome this challenge, the ISS makes use of modules that combine, like orbting Lego pieces, into a structure greater than its parts. While this sounds great in principle, over 40 rocket launches were needed to realise the ISS. While it allows significantly longer duration stays than the first space station (Salyut), the ISS usually holds only twice as many astronauts.

In the pre-Apollo years, from 1958 to 1961, NASA Langley developed two radically different architectures. The first explored the use of large tyre tubes (obviously made by Goodyear!) that inflate into wheel-shaped space stations- this is what James Webb is standing under, in the first image of this essay, and what engineers are walking within.

Prototypes were made from a variety of soft materials, such as rubber and nylon, which led to a concern that stronger fabrics were needed to prevent punctures from collisions with micrometeorites. After all, astronauts had to live in them!

The other idea was a  hub-and-spoke design that packed snugly into a rocket but deployed into a full hexagonal shape:

The work at Langley was notable for both its ambition to directly pursue von Braun's vision as well as its counterintuitive pursuit of "unitised" structures. This means the stations would be single structures that didn’t need to be assembled in space (not for the most part, at least). On the other hand, the ISS has required in-orbit assembly; this means it has been pieced together by astronauts, space cranes, and rendezvous-and-docking technologies. As a combination, these are the exact opposite of “faster, cheaper, safer”. Either one of these unitized architectures would have led us to stations far larger than the ISS, translating to greater scientific output alongside a deeper understanding of the impact of artificial gravity on human health. We might have even had several orbiting settlements distributed across the Solar System, taking us closer to an Asimovian future or that of Philip K. Dick's imagination of Mars settlements in _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_.

This is a far-cry from von Braun’s [estimated crew of 80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_wheel_space_station#:~:text=It%20was%20envisaged%20as%20having%20a%20crew%20of%C2%A080) and, more interestingly, Starship’s [crew of 100](https://www.spacex.com/media/starship_users_guide_v1.pdf). To get such a reasonably large group to Mars, a spacecraft must not only be large but also safe- in a way that Starship cannot be (as it looks like a zero g craft, for all intents and purposes). There are no public details on if its crew will make the journey to Mars in zero gravity. Potentially years-long, such trips can create health risks like [muscle atrophy and bone loss](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-021-00158-4). Mitigating these effects is why [ISS astronauts exercise for 2 hours daily](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/167746main_fs_livingandworkinginspace508c.pdf).

When one imagines early space station designs, the natural assumption might be that NASA pursued rigid, metallic structures - the kind of 'tin can' engineering that defined the Apollo Era. Yet from 1958 till 1961, NASA Langley was pursuing something far more radical: inflatable space stations that would deploy into giant donuts. This seemingly fragile approach wasn't just an engineering curiosity - it represented perhaps our best shot at achieving von Braun's vision of large rotating stations quickly.

Perhaps a line of research would have been initiated in 1961- we will never know. Soon after Apollo was announced by Kennedy, cancellation threats were issued to the ongoing space station development projects which had little relevance to landing man on the Moon in 8 years. The program survived through Langley’s leadership lobbying who convinced NASA HQ that larger stations were a logical successor to Apollo. The space station vision shrank to meet Apollo’s more modest needs: no artificial gravity and much smaller crews of 3. Post-Apollo era, NASA’s funding shrank and the Space Shuttle became the “logical successor” with a very limited station, Skylab, was launched based on Apollo technologies. The Soviet Union also cooled their interest in their lunar programme and started Salyut, the first serious space station programme.
