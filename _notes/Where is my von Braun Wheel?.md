In 1961. Or 1962. While the answer is disappointing, it is far less interesting than understanding how the Apollo program dismantled a serious effort to getting artificial gravity space stations.  Much of this engineering work was carried out at NASA's Langley- the home of [many other great projects undertaken there](https://angadh.com/translation/hungarianarticleaboutnasa). A series of decisions leading into and after Apollo then set us on the trajectory towards the smaller zero-gravity space stations that we eventually got. That is what I unpack here while also considering if a course-correction is needed.

# What is a vBW?
Rephrasing [Heinlein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress), space is a harsh mistress. Alongside radiation, [microgravity in various Earth orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness) is a concern for [human health](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-020-0095-y) leading to [muscle atrophy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-021-00158-4), [bone loss](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-020-0103-2), and [vision problems](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00654-7#:~:text=Spending%20long%20periods%20in%20the,that%20change%20how%20the%20eye). Modern-day astronauts spend [a few hours each day exercising](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/167746main_fs_livingandworkinginspace508c.pdf) to overcome some of these issues. For this reason, early space visionaries, such as Werner von Braun, strongly believed that settling the solar system required developing technologies to generate artificial gravity within orbiting habitats.

von Braun believed his technological solution - the rotating-wheel space station - was ['as inevitable as the rising sun’](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-stations/). In his 1949 sci-fi novel, “[Project Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mars:_A_Technical_Tale)”, humans reached the red planet using such stations and, in 1956, Disney worked with him to create the first visuals of this “[von Braun wheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JJL8CUfF-o)” , shown in **the** image below. In such systems, humans live along the periphery of a spinning wheel, within which they experience gravity. While it was popularized by von Braun, an image of this concept traces back to [Herman Potočnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Poto%C4%8Dnik#The_Problem_of_Space_Travel)'s 1929 book [_The Problem of Space Travel_](https://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-QK9YC09U). The legacy of the idea is probably why many felt that an operational station was, at best, a couple decades away.
![von Braun explaining the layout of his wheel-shaped station](assets/imgs/vonBraunWheel.jpg)

This elegant solution to generate artificial gravity, however, comes with a major engineering challenge. The gravity along the wheel is generated by rotating it and, like ferris wheels, motion sickness in astronauts would likely be prevented by spinning at low speeds. The resulting physics then dictates that these wheels be quite large. For example, one of von Braun's designs called for a massive 75-metre diameter wheel that generated lunar gravity if spun at 3 rpm and Earth-like gravity at 5 rpm, which are considered as [safe speeds to avoid disorientation among astronauts](https://nss.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Space-Settlement-Population-Rotation-Tolerance-Globus.pdf). However, the physics of rockets work in the opposite way; to enable taking things into space, a rocket must itself be slender, like an arrow, to escape earth's gravity well. For context, Starship's [upper-stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_(spacecraft)) is about 9 metres wide and 22 metres tall with most launchers being far smaller. This defines the main upstream engineering challenge: how can we realise enormous space structures using slender rockets?

# Challenge: Building large stations
Architects of the International Space Station (ISS), the largest largest space structure ever built, tackled this packing problem using multiple smaller spacecraft which connect, like space Ikea, into a structure greater than its parts. Such in-space assembly involves spacecraft either gently crashing into each other at specific connection points (a manoeuvre called [rendezvous and docking](https://www.nasa.gov/reference/jsc-rendezvous-prox-ops-docking-subsystems/)) as well as [astronauts and space cranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Servicing_System) supporting finer assembly tasks. While this works great in theory, the ISS's assembly needed over 40 rocket launches spanning several years (and even more launches for cargo resupply and repairs). More damning is the typical ISS crew size of 7, which is a little over twice that of the first ever space station, Salyut, from 1972. These numbers are a far-cry from von Braun’s [anticipated 80 humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_wheel_space_station#:~:text=It%20was%20envisaged%20as%20having%20a%20crew%20of%C2%A080) or, more relevant today, Starship’s [100](https://www.spacex.com/media/starship_users_guide_v1.pdf). As a result, civilisation-scale habitats like the Stanford Torus and O'Neill cylinders appear even more ridiculous today than when they were first proposed.

Clearly 50 years of space station development shows that modular in-orbit assembly has not provided evidence of scaling crew size nor a pathway to artificial gravity space station designs (whether we need these, I'll tackle later).

From today's vantage point, it is quite clear that the architectural bottleneck is a technology running through all operational space stations so far: their use of the Apollo-era small 'tin can' modular spacecraft as the centerpiece for assembly. This, in my opinion, is unfit for building large space stations for hundreds- at least not at scale or speed. But how did we get here?

To understand this, we have to look at pre-Apollo era space technology development programs. Yet from 1958 till 1961, NASA Langley pursued far more radical ideas to making artificial gravity stations. They explored two radically different architectures to accelerate towards Braun's vision. The first explored the use of large tyre tubes (obviously made by Goodyear!) that inflate into wheel-shaped space stations- this is what James Webb is standing under in the first image of this essay and the image below shows engineers walking within this human-scale tube. Made from soft materials, like rubber and nylon, there were concerns that collisions with micrometeorites could puncture the station and be fatal to astronaut life.

A six-month contract in 1961 allowed North American Aviation to look into hexagonal space stations made from hinge-connected rigid pipes based on one of Rene A. Berglund's many station concepts. This station could fold neatly into a rocket for launch and automatically deploy in-orbit. The rigidity of the habitable elements offered better protection to micrometeoroid collisions than Goodyear's rubber donut by incorporating sealable air-lock doors when any threat arose to the integrity of the interconnecting inflatable sections. A 15-foot prototype of the system was developed based on the table-top concept shown below.

These early concepts are notable not only in their ambition in directly pursuing von Braun's vision but also for what now feels like a very counterintuitive way of realising large stations as "unitised" structures i.e., a single structures that avoids or reduces needing in-orbit assembly. The initial plans for these architectures were designed for repeatability and scale which would leade to greater scientific output than all stations so far while offering a deeper understanding of the impact of artificial gravity on human health. We might even had several orbiting settlements distributed across the Solar System by now, taking us closer to an Asimovian future or that of Philip K. Dick's imagination of Mars settlements in _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_

In other words, the ISS and everything before it is the opposite of “faster, cheaper, better”.

## The Apollo Applications Program: A Pivot Point

This research at Langley's Manned Space Laboratory Research Group under Laurence Loftin was showing promising progress toward von Braun's rotating wheel vision, with the hexagonal station emerging as the leading concept.

Everything changed in May 1961. President Kennedy's landmark speech committing America to a lunar landing effectively sidelined these promising space station projects. The methodical approach envisioned by the early space pioneers—first building orbital infrastructure, then using it as a staging point for lunar missions—was suddenly bypassed in favor of a direct path to the Moon.

As Thompson at Langley noted, while "the clear and accepted objective of NASA's manned space effort following Project Mercury was to send an astronaut to the moon and back," the traditional approach would have been to move toward that goal "from an orbiting relay station." Kennedy's decision completely bypassed this incremental strategy.

The space station program survived only through Langley's persistent lobbying, which positioned larger stations as "the next logical step" after Apollo. However, the grand vision shrank dramatically to accommodate Apollo's more modest needs: zero gravity environments and crews of three rather than the 36 astronauts envisioned for the rotating hexagon.

Meanwhile, a parallel challenge was emerging within NASA's organizational structure. Wernher von Braun, whose Saturn rocket team at Marshall Space Flight Center had developed the powerful launchers needed for lunar missions, knew that his center would soon pass its peak of activity and "shrink in size at a relatively early date." He would face large layoffs even while other NASA centers were still actively preparing for the first Moon landing.

George E. Mueller, NASA's Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, understood von Braun's dilemma because he had helped create it. Mueller had previously worked on the Minuteman ICBM program, where he had successfully implemented "all-up testing" – a revolutionary approach where missiles flew with all stages active on their very first test. After joining NASA, Mueller convinced von Braun to apply this same approach to the Saturn V rocket, enabling it to fly "all-up" on its first test by firing all three of its stages.

This accelerated testing approach dramatically compressed the development schedule for Apollo. The success of Apollo 8 in orbiting the Moon on just the third Saturn V launch – achieved in December 1968 – demonstrated the effectiveness of Mueller's strategy. But this efficiency also created a potential surplus of Saturn-class rockets that could be available for purposes beyond the Moon landings.

To address both the post-Apollo planning needs and von Braun's staffing concerns, Mueller established a Saturn-Apollo Applications Program Office. Initially, discussions focused on ambitious budgets – Mueller hoped for $450 million for fiscal year 1967, with over $1 billion anticipated for FY 1968. Reality proved far harsher. The Bureau of the Budget slashed the FY 1967 request to a mere $42 million – less than a tenth of Mueller's initial mark.

The FY 1968 budget brought similar disappointments. Initial discussions between NASA and the Bureau of the Budget reduced the request from $626 million to $454 million – still enough to launch the program meaningfully. President Johnson endorsed this figure with an argument that would become familiar in subsequent years: "We have no alternative unless we wish to abandon the manned space capability we have created." But even with presidential support, Congress cut the authorization to $347 million, and NASA Administrator James Webb further reduced it by transferring funds to other activities. Apollo Applications was left with only $253 million, the bare minimum Mueller could accept.

These severe budget constraints forced NASA to scale back its post-Apollo ambitions dramatically. Early plans called for a "wet workshop" – a spent S-IVB rocket stage that would first serve as a propulsive stage and then be converted into living quarters once in orbit. As studies proceeded, however, the technical challenges of such a conversion became increasingly apparent.

The alternative was to build a "dry workshop" – a space station purpose-built on the ground with no provision for use as a rocket stage. But this approach required the use of a Saturn V to launch it, and NASA Administrator James Webb had fought hard to convince Congress and the Bureau of the Budget that Apollo required at least 15 Saturn V vehicles. He would not tolerate any suggestion that these precious rockets could be used for other purposes.

The success of Apollo 8 in December 1968 changed this calculus. With the Moon already orbited on just the third Saturn V launch, it became increasingly plausible that a Saturn V could be spared for Apollo Applications. Combined with mounting technical problems in the wet workshop approach, Mueller became convinced that only a dry workshop could save the program.

This pivot point led to what eventually became Skylab – America's first space station. While significant in its own right, Skylab fell far short of the grand rotating wheel stations previously envisioned. At 165,000 pounds, it utilized a Saturn V but, as Heppenheimer noted, "fell well short of the lifting power" available. The architecture of space stations had fundamentally changed – "the concept of a big rotating wheel fell by the wayside, in favor of designs that could fit atop a rocket as a single payload."

Post-Apollo, NASA's funding shrank considerably, and the Space Shuttle became the "logical successor" to Apollo, with Skylab serving as a limited station based on Apollo technologies. The Soviet Union, meanwhile, cooled their interest in their lunar program and started Salyut, the first serious space station program – but one that similarly abandoned the rotating wheel concept in favor of smaller, modular designs.

The early ambitions displayed in Langley's inflatable torus and North American's hexagonal station now seem like relics of a more optimistic era – one where large crews would live comfortably in rotating structures that generated artificial gravity. By 1963, Langley had abandoned "once and for all the long-held notion that a space station must continually rotate to provide artificial gravity." The agency's focus shifted instead to understanding how humans could adapt to extended stays in weightlessness – a fundamental change in approach that would define all subsequent space station development.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

## So will I ever get my Von Braun Wheel

Possibly. The commercial potential for rotating space stations is gaining attention once again. Jed McCaleb of Vast, one of the big players in commercial space station development, echoes von Braun that space stations would be useful for Mars transport as they’d be '[much nicer to live on than inside Starship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj5NlK1_gFI&t=2150s)’ and [artificial gravity stations are essential for humans living in space beyond a year](https://youtu.be/jj5NlK1_gFI?si=l0drrn9R2DDHbW5g&t=2479). Mars transport can range from months to years, depending on when we launch. That said, Vast appears to only be looking at spinning sticks building on the maturity of the Apollo-ear technologies. This is a step in the right direction but the limiting feature of this design is that any artificial gravity will only be at the very ends of the sticks. Every space station manufacturer today also believes they could help scale [in-space manufacturing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj5NlK1_gFI&t=2138s) for companies like Varda and Space Forge.

But the challenge remains a technical one, we need to work on scaling BEAM from its meagre 16 m3 inflated cylindrical-ish shape towards a [>6000 m3  von Braun wheels](https://www.angadhn.com/large%20space%20stations/space%20exploration/space-inflatables-1/#the-vision:~:text=916-,6217.85,-20x%20of%20ISS). To put these numbers in human terms: BEAM offers less space than the 65 m³ per person currently available on the ISS. What is ideal for a large von Braun wheel is actually unknown at this time.

The researchers at Langley have given us hints of the intermediate scales to test at but we need to revisit subscale testing using these newer materials. This will help identify/anticipate needs for larger modules. Current research indicates that we need new materials to make larger-than-BEAM space structures from inflatables ([see Figure 4](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas-Litteken/publication/333919095_System_Integration_Comparison_Between_Inflatable_and_Metallic_Spacecraft_Structures/links/5e75387392851cf2719a389c/System-Integration-Comparison-Between-Inflatable-and-Metallic-Spacecraft-Structures.pdf?__cf_chl_tk=pDGvn9SayN3u94_S2IxijTtcfUUkhKg0khQn23ldwPY-1735002576-1.0.1.1-tXvyxaLfG.lXVagYY.rMLfOHHkqRP9DP3HAh.jXshUY)). Further, the Langley designs and architectures were for Earth orbiting stations. New ones must be conceptualized and woven into the tapestry of space exploration that Starship is stitching. This design space will have to address:
- developing systems for inflation/deployment unique to these stations and understanding the structural dynamics throughout the process.
- crew transportation/docking for cargo and crew transfer.
- power systems for station operations in a Mars transport context.
- corresponding actuators and motion control (AOCS) to rotate the station for artificial gravity and also evaluate dynamic stability (eg movement of humans in a station can create a wobble).

This work won’t be straightforward but we do need to push for it because minimising modularity could reduce the slow in-space assembly as seen with the ISS.

Inflatable structures have minimal mechanical complexity, reduce failure points, and simplify construction. Moreover, our terrestrial experience doesn’t include living in inflatable habitats, making it non-obvious as a space solution. We’re accustomed to rigid structures so cannot envision lightweight, expandable living spaces as a viable alternative. Yet, in the vacuum of space, these structures provide vast habitable areas with superior radiation shielding and thermal management. This insight could have profound implications for future space missions. By embracing inflatable technologies, we can dramatically reduce launch costs, simplify construction processes, and create larger, more versatile space habitats than ever before. It’s a reminder that in space engineering, sometimes the most effective solutions are those that challenge our Earth-biased intuitions.

# Conclusion
While Mars feels closer than ever thanks to advances in rocket technology, we're still missing a critical piece of infrastructure: large rotating space stations. The path forward likely lies in revisiting and scaling up the inflatable concepts NASA Langley pioneered 60 years ago - an approach that could dramatically simplify construction while reducing assembly time and maintenance needs. Sometimes the best solutions for space aren't the ones that look most obvious on Earth.

Just like it’s better to have loved and lost than to not have loved at all, it’s also better to have Apollo’d and stopped than to never have Apollo’d at all.

Perhaps a line of research would have been initiated in 1961- we will never know. Soon after Apollo was announced by Kennedy, cancellation threats were issued to the ongoing space station development projects which had little relevance to landing man on the Moon in 8 years. The program survived through Langley’s leadership lobbying who convinced NASA HQ that larger stations were a logical successor to Apollo. The space station vision shrank to meet Apollo’s more modest needs: no artificial gravity and much smaller crews of 3. Post-Apollo era, NASA’s funding shrank and the Space Shuttle became the “logical successor” with a very limited station, Skylab, was launched based on Apollo technologies. The Soviet Union also cooled their interest in their lunar programme and started Salyut, the first serious space station programme.





# So what happened to these programs?

So, yes- this was quite an active period of commercial and NASA-led space station development. 1960’s NASA and today’s NASA are hamstrung in different ways. The Space Race era was about competition whereas today it is about cooperation. Competitions have proven to have short-term rewards that are hard to repeat; maybe it’s because they have incorrect targets or the wrong means to get to those targets or both. Apollo, an insane feat of engineering, probably had incorrect means because getting humans on the moon by 1970 while deprioritising a long-term reusable infrastructure like a space station doesn’t sit right. Especially when we haven’t gone back in 50 years but also because more progress was made by 1961 on the idea of large stations as platforms for routine and repeatable access to the Moon or Mars.

OTOH. Cooperation comes with coordination costs; for example, coordination between NASA, ESA, JAXA, Roscosmos gave an impressive ISS but underperforms as a research lab (tho I will say it is better than having nothing) and took a long time to build and has issues affected by the politics of the day. It’s not easy to build another ISS- let alone a bigger one- and also isn’t a platform for launching deep space missions (e.g., it has never been used as a staging platform for any Martian missions).  

So why does an org like SpaceX seem to work? Elon is a clear reason but also sometgin common to companies is the internal collaboration culture (which is more fluid than cooperation, ). This means coordination costs are low and paperwork/processes are also minimised. These systems are better at course correction- something govt orgs won’t typically do (maybe they can’t?). NASA’s Space Launch System is a terrific example of not course correcting.  

Today, [ITAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations) has a pretty massive impact on both NASA and SpaceX; America basically uses it to regulate who can and cannot work in the US space sector. This Elon reply (and the thread before the reply) are pretty good at summarising ITAR: [https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1695002550251213268](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1695002550251213268)

That said, it is in fashion to bash NASA right now. But I would like to remind readers that NASA excels at solving complex engineering challenges when given a clear mission focus- whether it was Apollo's lunar landings or the Space Shuttle's reusable orbiter development. This capability is perhaps best exemplified by JPL's remarkable track record with Mars missions: their evolution from early Viking landers to the sophisticated Curiosity and Perseverance rovers demonstrates an ability to build on experience and consistently execute challenging interplanetary missions. While other space agencies have struggled with Mars landings (like ESA's Beagle 2 and Russia's Mars 96), JPL has developed a repeatable expertise that makes the extraordinary seem routine. Their technologists pioneered a Martian landing technology that is now used to land SpaceX's rockets. So, the issue isn't NASA's engineering capability - it's about ensuring these formidable technical skills are directed toward the right long-term priorities for space development. And it’s about greeting a regulatory environment that allows more players to join in from all over the world by making ITAR a thing of the past.
