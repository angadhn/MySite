In 1961. Or maybe 1962.

While the answer is disappointing, it is far more interesting to understand how the Apollo program dismantled a serious engineering effort into building artificial gravity space stations at NASA's Langley- the [home of many great projects over the last century](https://angadh.com/translation/hungarianarticleaboutnasa).

A series of decisions- not just leading into but well after Apollo- which set us on a trajectory towards small zero-gravity space stations. How we got here is what I unpack here.

# What is a vBW?
Early space visionaries, such as Werner von Braun, strongly believed that settling the solar system required developing technologies to generate artificial gravity within orbiting habitats as- rephrasing [Heinlein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress)- space is a harsh mistress. Modern-day astronauts [exercise a few hours each day](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/167746main_fs_livingandworkinginspace508c.pdf) to overcome [microgravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness)'s effects on [the body](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-020-0095-y) such as [muscle atrophy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-021-00158-4), [bone loss](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-020-0103-2), and [vision problems](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00654-7#:~:text=Spending%20long%20periods%20in%20the,that%20change%20how%20the%20eye). von Braun was convinced that rotating-wheel space stations prevented such physiological problems and were thus ['as inevitable as the rising sun’](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-stations/)”. In these systems, humans live along the periphery of a wheel, within which they experience gravity due to the wheel's rotation. Popularised by von Braun in his 1949 sci-fi novel, _[Project Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mars:_A_Technical_Tale)_, and the [1956 Disney piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JJL8CUfF-o), the concept actually traces back to [Herman Potočnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Poto%C4%8Dnik#The_Problem_of_Space_Travel)'s 1929 book [_The Problem of Space Travel_](https://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-QK9YC09U). Its legacy is perhaps why many felt that an operational spinning station was, at best, a couple decades away.

# Challenge: Building large stations
This elegant solution to generate artificial gravity, however, comes with a major engineering challenge. Much like a ferris wheel, the wheel's rotation could disorient astronauts if spun too fast. If the wheel spins slowly then its physics dictates it must be quite large. For example, one of von Braun's designs called for a massive 75 metre diameter wheel that generated lunar gravity if spun at 3 rpm and Earth-like gravity at 5 rpm- this range is considered [reasonable for astronauts](https://nss.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Space-Settlement-Population-Rotation-Tolerance-Globus.pdf).

However, the physics of rockets present a different obstacle; a rocket must itself be slender, like an arrow, to escapes earth's gravity well and reach orbit. This defines the main upstream engineering challenge: how can we fit enormous space structures into slender rockets? For context, even Starship's [upper-stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_(spacecraft)), which is about 9 metres wide and 22 metres tall cannot fit von Braun's conceptual station in a straightforward manner.

Architects of the International Space Station (ISS), the largest space structure ever built, tackled this packing problem using multiple smaller spacecraft which connect, like space Ikea, into a structure greater than its parts. Such in-space assembly involves spacecraft either gently crashing into each other at specific connection points (a manoeuvre called [rendezvous and docking](https://www.nasa.gov/reference/jsc-rendezvous-prox-ops-docking-subsystems/)) as well as [astronauts and space cranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Servicing_System) supporting finer assembly tasks. While this works great in theory, the ISS's assembly needed over 40 rocket launches spanning several years (and even more launches for cargo resupply and repairs). More damning is the typical ISS crew size of 7, which is a little over twice that of the first ever space station, Salyut, from 1972. These numbers are a far-cry from von Braun’s [anticipated 80 humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_wheel_space_station#:~:text=It%20was%20envisaged%20as%20having%20a%20crew%20of%C2%A080) or, more relevant today, Starship’s [100](https://www.spacex.com/media/starship_users_guide_v1.pdf). As a result, civilisation-scale megastructures like the Stanford Torus and O'Neill cylinders appear even more ridiculous today than when they were first proposed.

Clearly 50 years of space station development shows that modular in-orbit assembly has not provided evidence of scaling crew size nor a pathway to artificial gravity space station designs (whether we need these, I'll tackle later).

From today's vantage point, it is quite clear that the architectural bottleneck is a technology running through all operational space stations so far: their use of the Apollo-era small 'tin can' modular spacecraft as the centerpiece for assembly. This, in my opinion, is unfit for building large space stations for hundreds- at least not at scale or speed. But how did we get here? To understand this, we have to look at pre-Apollo era space technology development programs.

## Station Development pre-Apollo
From 1959 till 1962, NASA Langley explored various architectures to accelerate towards von Braun's vision enabled. A former Director of Aeronautical Research at NASA Langley, Larry Loftin, saw crewed stations as essential for manned exploration of the moon and planets following the success of Project Mercury. In keeping with this, he instigated a conference in 1959 to explore ideas at Langley, two of which were taken to the prototype stage. 

The first explored the use of large tyre tubes (obviously made by Goodyear!) that inflate into wheel-shaped space stations- this is what James Webb is standing under in the first image of this essay; the image below shows engineers walking within this human-scale tube.

Made from soft materials, like rubber and nylon, there were concerns that collisions with micrometeorites could puncture the station with fatal outcomes. So, a six-month contract in 1961 was awarded to North American Aviation to look into hexagonal space stations made from hinge-connected rigid pipes based on one of Rene Berglund's many station concepts. His design folded neatly into a rocket for launch to automatically deploy in-orbit; the rigidity of its habitable elements offered better protection to micrometeoroid collisions than Goodyear's rubber donut. It did so by incorporating air-lock doors that sealed if any threat arose to the integrity of the inflatable tubes connecting the habitats to the central hub. A 15-foot prototype of the system was developed, based on the table-top concept shown below. It was estimated that either system could be realised for $100 million (approximately a billion dollars in 2025) but, over time, the hexagonal station emerged as the most promising concept at Langley's Manned Space Laboratory Research Group.

## The Apollo Applications Program: A Pivot Point
Things would change in May 1961, following President Kennedy's landmark speech committing America to a lunar landing instead of merely orbiting the moon, as originally planned. This would effectively sideline the space station projects over the next years. The methodical approach envisioned by Loftin and von Braun to use a station as a staging point for lunar missions was bypassed in favor of a direct path to the Moon. The space station program survived only through Langley's persistent lobbying, which positioned larger stations as "the next logical step" after Apollo. However, by 1963, the vision shrank dramatically to accommodate Apollo's more modest needs: zero gravity environments and crews of three rather than the 36 astronauts envisioned for the rotating hexagon. This work was pursued under the Manned Orbiting Research Laboratory (MORL) program.

Elsewhere, a parallel challenge was emerging within NASA's Marshall Space Flight where the Saturn rockets were being developed. Its head, Wernher von Braun knew that his ‘s rocket team would soon face layoffs while other centers actively prepared for the first Moon landing. This was a problem created by George E. Mueller, NASA's Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, who gambled on the revolutionary "all-up testing" to accelerate Saturn development; in this method, all stages of a rocket are flight-tested at once. Mueller had previously seen the success of this approach in the Minuteman ICBM program, where missiles flew with all stages active on their very first test. Mueller's gamble to do so with larger space rockets paid off and Apollo 8 orbited the Moon on just the third Saturn V launch in December 1968. But Mueller also understood that this efficiency threatened von Braun's team.

To pre-empt post-Apollo planning needs and address von Braun's staffing concerns, Mueller established a Saturn-Apollo Applications Program Office in 1965. This program would eventually fuse with Langley's early space station work; in 1967, the MORL concept was studied as an Earth-orbiting station that could also support a crewed Mars trip. In parallel, Marshall looked into two Earth-orbiting stations for astronomy and biological research, respectively. These studies went ahead only because of the interests of the two centres’ directors but lacked much support from NASA Headquarters.

This is evident from how follow on budgets played out for Apollo Applications. Mueller had hoped to secure $450 million in 1967 and over $1 billion in FY 1968. Reality proved far harsher as the Bureau of the Budget slashed the FY 1967 request to a mere $42 million and the FY 1968 budget brought similar disappointments. Initial discussions between NASA and the Bureau of the Budget reduced the request from $626 million to $454 million. President Johnson endorsed this figure with an argument that would become familiar in subsequent years: "We have no alternative unless we wish to abandon the manned space capability we have created." But even with presidential support, Congress cut the authorization to $347 million, and NASA Administrator James Webb further reduced it by transferring funds to other activities. Apollo Applications was left with only $253 million, the bare minimum Mueller could accept. These severe budget constraints ensured there would be no ambitious post-Apollo missions.

Nonetheless studies progressed, which looked into "wet" stations – a spent rocket stage that would first serve as a propulsive stage and then be converted into living quarters in orbit- and "dry " ones – a space station built on the ground and launched within a rocket. Mueller was convinced that the less complex dry station would be successful but required a Saturn V which James Webb was unwilling to spare. Webb had fought hard to convince Congress and the Bureau of the Budget that Apollo required at least 15 Saturn V vehicles. His reluctance to share a rocket is understandable as Mueller’s request was well before Apollo 8, whose eventual success made it increasingly likely that a Saturn V could be spared for Apollo Applications.

The Apollo Applications and MORL ideas eventually became Skylab – America's first space station. While significant in its own right, Skylab fell far short of the grand rotating wheel stations previously envisioned and used only a fraction of the Saturn V’s lifting power. Post-Apollo, NASA's funding shrank considerably, and the Space Shuttle became the "logical successor" to Apollo, with Skylab serving as a limited station based on Apollo technologies. The Soviet Union, meanwhile, cooled their interest in their lunar program and started Salyut, the first long-term space station program.

The early ambitions displayed in Langley's inflatable torus and North American's hexagonal station now seem like relics of a more optimistic era – one where large crews would live comfortably in rotating structures that generated artificial gravity. These early concepts are notable not only in their ambition in directly pursuing von Braun's vision but also for what now feels like a very counterintuitive way of realising large stations as "unitised" structures i.e., a single structure that eliminates or reduces the need for in-orbit assembly. The initial plans for these architectures were designed for repeatability and scale which could've led to greater scientific output than all stations so far while offering a deeper understanding of the impact of artificial gravity on human health- something unstudied to date. We might have even had several orbiting settlements distributed across the Solar System by now, taking us closer to an Asimovian future of space settlements.

This is probably a good time to note that I am quite critical of Apollo. But just like it’s better to have loved and lost than to not have loved at all, it’s also better to have Apollo’d and stopped than to never have Apollo’d at all.

## So will I ever get my Von Braun Wheel

Possibly. The commercial potential for rotating space stations is gaining attention once again. Jed McCaleb of Vast, one of the big players in commercial space station development, echoes von Braun that space stations would be useful for Mars transport as they’d be '[much nicer to live on than inside Starship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj5NlK1_gFI&t=2150s)’ and [artificial gravity stations are essential for humans living in space beyond a year](https://youtu.be/jj5NlK1_gFI?si=l0drrn9R2DDHbW5g&t=2479). Mars transport can range from months to years, depending on when we launch. That said, Vast appears to only be looking at spinning sticks building on the maturity of the Apollo-era technologies. This is a step in the right direction but the limiting feature of this design is that any artificial gravity will only be at the very ends of the sticks.

</div>

Then there is the matter of closing the business case for these stations. Almost all space station companies today believe they offer a platform to scale for startups like Varda and Space Forge [in-space manufacturing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj5NlK1_gFI&t=2138s). These companies are leveraging microgravity to produce better pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. This allows station manufacturers to develop technologies focused on deploying larger volumes rapidly that resemble wheel-shaped stations while leaving the artificial gravity aspect for later in the roadmap; this will support long-duration stays and interplanetary travel. Langley's earlier work concluded rigid hexagonal stations were superior on account of the delicate nature of the inflatable fabric; this would require little new engineering research and is something that could be pursued in a 0-g scenario. At the same time, there is also need for research on inflatable soft goods.

We’re accustomed to rigid structures on Earth and so do not often think of lightweight, expandable living spaces made from textiles as a viable alternative. However, inflatables have minimal mechanical complexity, reduce failure points, and simplify construction. Yet, in the vacuum of space, textile-based structures could provide vast habitable areas with superior radiation shielding and thermal management. This insight is not particularly new as the
[Bigelow Expandable Module (BEAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigelow_Expandable_Activity_Module), a small inflatable module on the ISS, has [proven stronger than the metallic modules](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas-Litteken/publication/333919095_System_Integration_Comparison_Between_Inflatable_and_Metallic_Spacecraft_Structures/links/5e75387392851cf2719a389c/System-Integration-Comparison-Between-Inflatable-and-Metallic-Spacecraft-Structures.pdf?__cf_chl_tk=pDGvn9SayN3u94_S2IxijTtcfUUkhKg0khQn23ldwPY-1735002576-1.0.1.1-tXvyxaLfG.lXVagYY.rMLfOHHkqRP9DP3HAh.jXshUY) to Micrometeoroids and Orbital Debris (MMOD) collisions and is just as safe from radiation. But, at 16 m³, it needs efforts into [discovering new high-strength soft materials](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas-Litteken/publication/333919095_System_Integration_Comparison_Between_Inflatable_and_Metallic_Spacecraft_Structures/links/5e75387392851cf2719a389c/System-Integration-Comparison-Between-Inflatable-and-Metallic-Spacecraft-Structures.pdf?__cf_chl_tk=pDGvn9SayN3u94_S2IxijTtcfUUkhKg0khQn23ldwPY-1735002576-1.0.1.1-tXvyxaLfG.lXVagYY.rMLfOHHkqRP9DP3HAh.jXshUY) to enable a 6000 m³  von Braun wheel. These ideas would weave perfectly into the tapestry for space exploration being stitched by Starship; the successor to the Saturn V needs ideas as ambitious as the Langley family of stations.

# So what happened to these programs?

So, yes- this was quite an active period of commercial and NASA-led space station development. 1960’s NASA and today’s NASA are hamstrung in different ways. The Space Race era was about competition whereas today it is about cooperation. Competitions have proven to have short-term rewards that are hard to repeat; maybe it’s because they have incorrect targets or the wrong means to get to those targets or both. Apollo, an insane feat of engineering, probably had incorrect means because getting humans on the moon by 1970 while deprioritising a long-term reusable infrastructure like a space station doesn’t sit right. Especially when we haven’t gone back in 50 years but also because more progress was made by 1961 on the idea of large stations as platforms for routine and repeatable access to the Moon or Mars.

OTOH. Cooperation comes with coordination costs; for example, coordination between NASA, ESA, JAXA, Roscosmos gave an impressive ISS but underperforms as a research lab (tho I will say it is better than having nothing) and took a long time to build and has issues affected by the politics of the day. It’s not easy to build another ISS- let alone a bigger one- and also isn’t a platform for launching deep space missions (e.g., it has never been used as a staging platform for any Martian missions).  

So why does an org like SpaceX seem to work? Elon is a clear reason but also sometgin common to companies is the internal collaboration culture (which is more fluid than cooperation, ). This means coordination costs are low and paperwork/processes are also minimised. These systems are better at course correction- something govt orgs won’t typically do (maybe they can’t?). NASA’s Space Launch System is a terrific example of not course correcting.  

Today, [ITAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations) has a pretty massive impact on both NASA and SpaceX; America basically uses it to regulate who can and cannot work in the US space sector. This Elon reply (and the thread before the reply) are pretty good at summarising ITAR: [https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1695002550251213268](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1695002550251213268)

That said, it is in fashion to bash NASA right now. But I would like to remind readers that NASA excels at solving complex engineering challenges when given a clear mission focus- whether it was Apollo's lunar landings or the Space Shuttle's reusable orbiter development. This capability is perhaps best exemplified by JPL's remarkable track record with Mars missions: their evolution from early Viking landers to the sophisticated Curiosity and Perseverance rovers demonstrates an ability to build on experience and consistently execute challenging interplanetary missions. While other space agencies have struggled with Mars landings (like ESA's Beagle 2 and Russia's Mars 96), JPL has developed a repeatable expertise that makes the extraordinary seem routine. Their technologists pioneered a Martian landing technology that is now used to land SpaceX's rockets. So, the issue isn't NASA's engineering capability - it's about ensuring these formidable technical skills are directed toward the right long-term priorities for space development. And it’s about greeting a regulatory environment that allows more players to join in from all over the world by making ITAR a thing of the past.
