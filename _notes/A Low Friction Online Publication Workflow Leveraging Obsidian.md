I am a big time and longtime fan of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for notes- it is my note-taking
tool of choice both for its usability and, just as importantly, its [ethos](https://stephango.com/file-over-app).
However, my use of it recently reduced when I started using [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/)
as a template for my website; I actually spent a lot of time making it fit
with the Tufte design ideology. With the emergence of [Cursor](https://cursor.ai), my workflow became
one of constantly tweaking this website but also writing blogposts in markdown within Cursor. I then also started using it take quick notes. This made me go into the terrible workflow of more directories and general website management- too much friction.

And anyone who has written notes on Obsidian knows how awesome it is. I can't place my finger on it but I think it is fantastic as a place to type. Also Obsidian Publish is just so good- it's so easy to get your notes out into the wild. But the appearance of Obsidian Publish[^1] was something I wanted more control over; I like the Tufte design a lot as I think it reflects how I think as a writer. I also want my site to feel personal and (somewhat) tastefully built. 

So, lamenting the loss of Obsidian as an editor but also all my notes, I decided I had to carve out some time to immerse myself in building a Jekyll website in Tufte style that builds straight out of Obsidian. This is now working and is (largely) representative of my personality without making compromises in my workflow.

For anyone looking to do the same, I recommend [this post by Steph Ango](https://stephango.com/vault)  on publishing websites from Obsidian with low friction by leveraging Obsidian's Git plugin, Jekyll, Github, and Netlify. I also saw Steph Ango has ButtonDown to make his website into a Newsletter. This [blogpost](https://michaelsoolee.com/buttondown-newsletter-5-reasons/) made it sound nice too so I decided I would build this into  my  Jekyll site; [guidance for this integration is here](https://buttondown.com/blog/netlify). [[TheSiteRepo/_notes/My Jekyll Site had ButtonDown Integration Issues|This note]] tells you of some issues I had with integrating ButtonDown in my Jekyll+Netlify site. Hope it helps someone.

[^1]: I am still paying for Obsidian Publish to host my notes for the moment- I have about 11 months on it so I will see what to do with it in future.
