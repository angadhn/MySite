Jurassic Park has aged so confusingly. Undoubtedly awe-inspiring visually—not just for its action set pieces but also its sweeping vistas where dinosaurs populate lush, verdant landscapes with the same abundant density of life that characterises Hieronymous Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights.

The circumstances under which I rewatched this once-upon-a-time childhood favourite of mine cannot be divulged but, in concert with the hilariously cringey dialogue from characters with personalities only as complex as the dinosaurs, it delivered an unmistakable clarity on how my erratically [premium mediocre](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/) taste in movies could be traced to its specific early exposure. These are the kind of movies that sweep you into  its gravitational pull and escaping its orbit is not too different from perennial cycles of doomscrolling. It’s just easy to watch this stuff.

I first saw this movie nearly 30 years ago—yes, I’m now as old as the dinosaurs—so obviously didn’t realise that this was such bad cinema (barring the amazing action!)! Then, I read the damn books when I was 12—and I loved them. And I loved Timeline, too. Shoot me! But damn, even I know better than to go back and read Crichton now.

Now I have been wise to not see anything beyond Jurassic Park…3? But as a film series, it is somewhat responsible for spinning out a universe of Marvel Cinematic Garbage (MCG)- an assault on the senses I enjoy just as much as the next person enjoys the T-Rex intro/chase! But, with many thanks to my renewed clarity in this viewing, it was no longer hard to see that how Jurassic Parm symbolised the beginning of the great sloppification of Hollywood and Crichton’s role in making it happen. I wondered if he might even be responsible for the current sloppification of science itself, for example, with dubious claims of [lab-grown direwolves](https://bsky.app/profile/philipcball.bsky.social/post/3lprov46mp22x)?

The sequels have not stopped with the Jurassic dino-verse, exemplifying that Hollywood will give us pretty much exactly more of what markets enjoy sadly. They could make us want shiny new things but why do that when we can recycle cloudy dusty objects. It is hard to not see the movie industry as a truly sustainable one! Once I noticed it I couldn’t unsee it but this series Is also how we got the endless supply of movies from MCG. A series comparable to the Jurassics with marginally better dialogue peppered with punchlines and even more spectacular scenes. Boy, have I enjoyed these films, with one action set piece after another. But, unlike Jurassic Park, there is so much of this stashed into one movie that my memory is numbed by the end. I remember as much from these movies as the last pizza I ate.

Despite the hamming of John Hammond, the movie is prescient on the nature of scientific funding, with the dangling of his philanthropic carrot to convince a palaeontologist pair to vet his Jurassic Park. But such momentary maturity is overshadowed by the portrayal of scientists as a thoughtless bunch of self-serving rock stars. The unsubtle use of “[Newman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newman_(Seinfeld))” as the archetypical caricature character as a bumbling agent of chaos ensures a lack of relief from these fundamentally unrealistic traits in scientists and engineers. That a place as unique as JP would have just one underpaid IT admin seems ludicrous and that this person would jeopardise safety instead of just quitting their job for something better (while escaping with some secret space) made me think, “how can this movie try to take itself seriously as sci-fi with slop like that”.

Also, Hollywood has a weird understanding of taste—why cast [David Attenborough]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough)’s [brother](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Attenborough) as the hubristic Hammond? A minor misdemeanour compared to the careless characterisation of geneticists. I was baffled by another Easter egg that these probably best-in-class scientists hadn’t evaluated the potential for sex reversal in dinosaurs [^1]. InGen made all the dinosaurs female to prevent breeding and maintain population control. But then - surprise! - some dinosaurs have been changing from female to male and reproducing anyway.
All because they used frog DNA to fill gaps in their dinosaur genome but some frog species change their sex when environmental conditions favor it (like when there aren’t enough males around). Now, any competent geneticist would have researched this basic biological property before using frog DNA. If your entire business model depends on preventing dinosaur reproduction by controlling sex ratios, and you’re supplementing with frog genes, you’d definitely want to know “hey, can frogs change sex?” It’s not some obscure scientific fact to the expert but seems like a rudimentary biology check that would be relevant to their work. But moments like this prey on the audience’s ignorance and stupidity more than anything else.

To consistently paint humans—especially those in science who’s technical judgment is central to their livelihood—so poorly while utilising ingenious engineers to deliver a first-of-its-kind movie is egregious on Spielberg’s part. And it doesn’t get papered over by a child hacker saving *team humans* from *team raptors* in the conclusion. Also why are these dinos portrayed as smarter/more adaptive than humans? I mean, come on! They were only born yesterday, in a lab but somehow can adapt to modern human surroundings intelligently to undo millions of years of ignorance?

While I was mostly disappointed as I [live-tweeted](https://x.com/angadhn/status/1923452612453560732) this movie watching experience, I’m newly thankful to the internet for Jeff Goldblum’s magical gif.

I think what really vexed me into frustrated live-tweeting was that for a movie that could be so much more, it ends up as yet another dystopian vision via sci-fi—aside from being unoriginal, the deeply problematic premise about horrible philanthropist and thoughtless scientists just gets under my skin because such dystopian views do not emerge from shallow decision making by some of the smartest people. I’m get to see such totally hollow humans in my line of work. I do hope the community proves to be better as they progress technology.

I did soldier on to rewatch “The Lost World” to ensure total annihilation of my childhood memories. In the WWE, he’d definitely go by Steven “The Spectacle” Spielberg but I’m now done with such cinematic opulence. I can only wonder about the many productive child-hours I lost to the Jurassic Park movies. But, in the long term, I may have been cured of my hunger for sloppified Hollywood menagerie.
