The following is a list of notes I intend to expand on further, such as:
-  [[Moravec's Paradox]]

There are some others that could be more technical that a historical perspective on:
- the role of rendezvous and docking in space stations that combines knowledge from:
	-  [[ISS assembly animation]]
	-  [[ISS Rendezvous & Docking]]
	-  [[ISS Connectors]]
	-  [[Examples of Commercial Space Stations]]
	Ideally this piece would offer some kind of perspective on bottlenecks and future directions
	we might wish to develop.
- A deeper perspective on inflatable stations developed thru history and where we might wish to futher invest in R&D:
	-  [[inflatable von Braun Stations]] +  [[BEAM video summary]]
	-  [[Reading Links Jan 2025 Part 3]] that has content on inflatables
	- [[Saul Griffith on Inflatables]]
