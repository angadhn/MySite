I am an outlier- a millennial technologist in academia trying to build a startup to get out of the rat race, I have been unfortunate enough to come across three distinct kinds of technologists when looking for cofounders.
# Zoomer Technologists
Young tech professionals and creators (born ~1997-2012) who:
- Have an intuitive understanding of digital platforms and emerging technologies
- Often focus on social impact, sustainability, and ethical tech
- Tend toward decentralized systems, Web3, and creator economies
- Approach tech development with different assumptions than previous generations
- Blend technological innovation with cultural values like inclusivity and authenticity

# Boomer Technologists
Tech veterans and pioneers (born ~1946-1964) who:
- Witnessed and helped create the personal computing revolution
- Often have deep experience with foundational technologies and systems
- May have perspectives shaped by earlier tech paradigms and business models
- Include many of the founders of today's tech giants and infrastructure
- Possess institutional knowledge about technology's evolution

# Doomer Technologists
Tech professionals with pessimistic outlooks who:
- Focus on existential tech risks like AI safety, surveillance, or digital authoritarianism
- May work on resilience technologies, privacy tools, or decentralized systems
- Often critique mainstream tech optimism and highlight unintended consequences
- Sometimes see technological development as accelerating societal problems
- May advocate for more cautious approaches to emerging technologies

Each represents a distinct relationship between generational/philosophical outlook and technological development.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
