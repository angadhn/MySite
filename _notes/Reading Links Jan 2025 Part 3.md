- In preparing my WiP piece, I have been reading Hansen's Spaceflight Revolution. This led me to find Berglund's [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US3169725A/en) for the [Hexagon Space Station](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a4/81/3b/cbb51975e79b10/US3169725.pdf).
- I also skimmed these resources while preparing my Astera proposal:
	- [Certification Guidelines For Crewed Inflatable Softgoods Structures](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220011425)
	- [Micro-Meteoroid and Orbital Debris (MMOD) Protection Overview](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20190001193/downloads/20190001193.pdf)
- I should also read [Whipple Shield and Sizing Equations](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19920010826/downloads/19920010826.pdf) to  will help me better understand modular MMOD protection suggested by Gordon.
