With increasing frequency of writing creatively[^1], I can see that “trying to write” is easier than “trying to write with wit”, the latter I have been trying and failing at. With regular efforts, the idea to “try to write” becomes, in fact, so dumb… so trivial; but, if I slip, I easily forget that all I must do is tell myself “like, pick up a fucking pen”! The pen is important for me because it makes the act of writing more enjoyable, especially a fountain pen but the mechanical pencil is pleasing but I find it is useful in idea-sketching.

Armed with pen, writing then becomes merely the act of making a sentence—no lofty ambitions of trying to make a point or make it funny or anything of that sort. After one sentence, make another, and so on. And if it feels like the sentences are in some kind of dialogue, then I could just go on for a couple hours—and, I am hoping that ant some point, even humour will emerge in such writing. And, heck, who knows, maybe even a point might get made! And, if it so happens that a point emerge—and I feel it has in my writings, albeit often only clear only to me—it’s because this is a value taking voice from within the writer’s heart, for therein also lives desire, the source of our folly or fame—betwixt which are the more personal emotions of fear and fulfilment—and other feelings that can manifest as words and even other creations.

Recently, I have been able to observe desire in its various forms and distinguish one of its versions that spurs in me the need to write—perhaps all of these desire can be channeled so but I think it’s also healthy to maybe just have decoupled versions (and then call it something else, like lust or hunger). I use this observation of writing desire and try to follow it up with the act of writing with immediacy and urgency. I do this because I suspect that a writer who has experienced enough raw unfiltered sentences notices better when others have done so{% sidenote 'aka' "It’s very important to read." %} but will also learn to see the point of their writing emerge sooner. I continue to subject myself to the act of writing on pen-and-paper, even if it is for just half a page, as I am still quite weak at this kind of point-emergent writing. But every time a point manifests, I clearly see that it’s not the mind that generates sentences, but the heart—the home, as I said, of desire, of feeling.

The mind has two roles in (creative) writing: it’s a container for words you personally know, like a personal dictionary, and it can also edit to create structure from a bunch of words; obviously there must be a minimal density of content that can be massaged into an organised form for this role to kick in. Increasingly, I see how LLMs are a (useful) crutch for a budding writer trying to capture every thought. So the mind’s role can either be relegated to such a tool or augmented by it—I think we will see works of writing of the kind we haven’t seen before leveraging multimedia in ways authors have maybe only loosely imagined with these tools. But the heart’s role is not so easy to relegate to this machine.

So the present challenge then, for me, is to stay attentive; to observe the heart sufficiently and from it the world effectively, and then translate into the task of writing with urgency so that lightning bolt of instant feeling captured in a bottle like kindling to start a fire.

These days, it just so happens this observation of the heart’s desire happens most often whilst reading[^2], an activity I seem to commit most of my attention and time towards. Yet, humour has not emerged in my writing organically yet. This objective, I think, is the kind of personal touch that could elevate my writing  above the standard LLM garble{% sidenote 'slop' "some of you are more familiar with the technical term for this phenomenon- AI slop." %} in the wild as it is something few humans do effectively.

In a sense, I don’t see writing too differently from long-form meditation as both are about training the mind to cede control to another part of the body by observing that specific part‘s experience of reality. For example, in Vipassana meditation{% sidenote  'vip1' "If this is an incorrect interpretation of instructions, that‘s on me." %}, my mind learned to cede control to the skin—specifically, by observing the region around the nose in the early days followed by other parts during scanning—and progressing towards observing something far broader while simultaneously deeper. And through this I feel like sometimes I felt reaching something more fundamental. The parallel with writing then is that the activity is to observe the sensations of the heart and ceding control to it in that moment through a pen or keyboard and, maybe, a fundamental point is sometimes reached.

[^1]: This is quite different from the _academic scientific writing_ I do for work, which is more about proposals and articles. While both class of documents tend to be less stream-of-consciousness (which I class as creative writing), when it comes to proposals, newer funders request two-pagers with little room for references or make use of ”forms”. These bring it closer to creative writing but is still roughly 25%-30% made up of crisp summaries of past ideas to motivate your own. Over time, it can become less “original” writing as you have ready to go answers.

[^2]: Other activities that trigger this are conversations with friends, who are similarly engaged in dialogue with themselves, or even in conversation with Claude about mundane things.
