With enough frequency of creative writing[^1], I have understood that “trying to write” is easier than “trying to write with wit”. That’s because the idea to “try to write” is, in fact, so dumb… so trivial; all I really have to do is tell myself “like, pick up a fucking pen”!

Writing then becomes merely the act of making a sentence—no lofty ambitions trying to make a point or make it funny or anything of that sort. After one sentence, make another, and so on. And maybe, if it feels like dialogue, then humour emerges. Heck, who knows, even a point might actually eventually exist in those lines. And, if it does, it because it actually lives in the writer’s heart, for therein also lives desire– the source of folly or fame but between these also lie personal matters fear and fulfilment– and other feelings that can manifest as words and even other creations.

Recently, I have been able to observe desire specifically and distinguish it as one specifically to write. I use this observation and follow it up with the act of writing. I suspect a writer who has experienced enough sentences—written not just by oneself but also by others{% sidenote 'aka' "aka reading." %}—will maybe see a point emerge. While I am still quite bad at this kind of point-emergent writing, I do see that it’s not the mind that generates sentences, but the heart.

As I now see it, the mind has two roles in (creative) writing: it’s a container for words you personally know, like a personal dictionary, and it’s can also edit to create structure from a bunch of words; obviously there must be a minimal density of content that can be massaged into an organised form for this role to kick in.

So the challenge then, for me, has been to stay attentive; to observe the heart sufficiently and translate that into the act of writing, with urgency so the lightning of instant feeling is captured in a bottle.

In that sense, I don’t see writing too differently from long-form meditation as both are about training the mind to cede control to another part of the body by observing that specific part‘s experience of reality. For example, in Vipassana meditation{% sidenote  'vip1' "If this is an incorrect interpretation of instructions, that‘s on me." %}, my mind learned to cede control to the skin—specifically, by observing the region around the nose in the early days followed by other parts during scanning—and progressing towards observing something far broader while simultaneously deeper. And through this I feel like sometimes I felt reaching something more fundamental. The parallel with writing then is that the activity is to observe the sensations of the heart and ceding control to it in that moment through a pen or keyboard and, maybe, a fundamental point is sometimes reached.

These days, it just so happens this observation of the heart’s desire happens most often whilst reading[^2], an activity I seem to commit most of my attention and time towards.

Yet, humour has not emerged in my writing organically yet. This objective might not merely elevate my writing  above the standard LLM garble{% sidenote 'slop' "some of you are more familiar with the technical term for this phenomenon- AI slop." %} in the wild but to do something that few humans can effectively.

[^1]: This is quite different from the _academic scientific writing_ I do for work, which is more about proposals and articles. While both class of documents tend to be less stream-of-consciousness (which I class as creative writing), when it comes to proposals, newer funders request two-pagers with little room for references or make use of ”forms”. These bring it closer to creative writing but is still roughly 25%-30% made up of crisp summaries of past ideas to motivate your own. Over time, it can become less “original” writing as you have ready to go answers.

[^2]: Other activities that trigger this are conversations with friends, who are similarly engaged in dialogue with themselves, or even in conversation with Claude about mundane things.
