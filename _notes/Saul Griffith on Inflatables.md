I have [[inflatable von Braun Stations|previously written]] about inflatable tubes as a means to realising a von Braun wheel. The 
idea of using inflatables is clearly old. Learning about Saul Griffith's robotics work in this 
area has been fun to see when I started thinking about using inflatables for space robotic
applications in the summer of 2024. Here are two interesting pieces of media from Saul Griffith.
1. A Wired piece on him and [Otherlab](https://www.wired.com/2012/11/saul-griffith/#).
2. A second is  his talk (at Google X?):
