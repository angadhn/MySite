1. David Graeber opines on [flying cars and technological stagnation](https://davidgraeber.org/wp-content/uploads/2012-Of-flying-cars-and-the-declining-rate-of-profit.pdf), which is a good companion to [[Graeber and Thiel|my earlier post on his debate with Thiel]].

2. A friend shared Varoufakis's post on [Star Trek's model for a techno-optimist utopia](https://unherd.com/2025/01/why-the-left-needs-to-watch-star-trek/); I generally was left feeling that [[Varoufakis offers no solutions to achieve his vision]].

3. In addition, I am reading Eric Berger's [Liftoff](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Liftoff-Desperate-Early-Launched-SpaceX/dp/0008445621), which grounds the reality of building SpaceX against these utopian visions.
