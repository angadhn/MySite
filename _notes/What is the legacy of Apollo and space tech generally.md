When one thinks of the legacy of systems and organisations, one think of the tools and technologies that have outlasted the projects/programs that spun them into existence. For example, the manufacturing transistors moved from institutions outside of where they were discovered. Similarly, the personal computer and the network technologies did not remain caged in their homes at Xerox-PARC and Bell Labs but found their way to other manufacturers and eventually our homes.

it is hard to understand the legacy of the Apollo missions.
