I sometimes get wound up enough that I will want to dive deeper into something in a research-y sense (especially on space things) but sometimes I contemplatively write from a place of inspiration or frustration. These will eventually become [[Things that move me enough to freewrite]]. Occassionally, I will get asked to write something. The below is a list of longer pieces that emerge from such writing in no specific order:
- [[Some Space Stations in Fiction and Reality]]
- [[Inflatable von Braun Stations]]
- [[Graeber and Thiel on Stagnation]] was from 
- [[Varoufakis offers no solutions to achieve his vision]] was because of my frustration at his article.
- [[New York to Paris in 30 mins? How to achieve Elon Muskâ€™s vision of rockets replacing long haul]] was a piece requested by The Conversation- being in the right place at the right time.
