    "The ISS has solar panels on the port and starboard side, which is why the trusses they are attached to have names like P-6 and S-6. So on the port side, there are 8 solar array wings (abbreviated \"SAW\") and a similar number on the starboard side. When fully extended, each wing is 35 metres (115 ft) in length and 12 metres (39 ft) wide is the largest ever deployed in space, weighing over 2,400 pounds (1,100 kg). Each SAW generates nearly 31 Kilowatts (kW) of direct current power. Altogether, the eight solar array wings can generate about 240 kilowatts in direct sunlight, or about 84 to 120 kilowatts average power (cycling between sunlight and shade).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the power density based on wing spans works out to about 71.43 $$W/m^2$$ but each wing is actually made from two photovoltaic blankets. A blanket comprise 16,400 cells; each cell is 8-cm by 8-cm. So the power density of a wing with two blankets is actually 142.9 $$W/m^2$$."
